//! Transcript-derived advice: what recurred in the sessions recorded
//! under a repository, and whether a CLAUDE.md on the path already
//! states it.
//!
//! # The question, and what answers it
//!
//! A CLAUDE.md author wants to know what kept going wrong in this
//! directory. A command that failed and was then corrected (`yarn lint`
//! then `make lint`), a user saying "no, use X", a call auto mode refused,
//! the same grep run in ten sessions: each is a rule that could exist in
//! the CLAUDE.md that directory loads. Every signal here is a string or
//! structure test over JSONL records. No model runs on anything (#1198).
//!
//! | signal | detection | finding when |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | S1 corrected command | Bash A with `is_error: true` (or stderr and no stdout), then within the next [`CORRECTION_LOOKAHEAD`] Bash calls a B whose head differs, shares a non-flag token, and has `is_error: false` | same A-head → B-head in ≥ [`MIN_SESSIONS_CORRECTED`] sessions |
//! | S2 user correction | a `user` text record whose first 6 words hold a word from [`NEGATIONS`], within [`CORRECTION_WINDOW`] records after a `tool_use` | same tool + head/path in ≥ [`MIN_SESSIONS_USER_CORRECTION`] sessions |
//! | S3 denied call | `is_error: true` whose text carries one of [`DENIAL_PHRASES`], plus `claude_hook_event` `PermissionDenied` rows | same tool + head in ≥ [`MIN_SESSIONS_DENIED`] sessions |
//! | S4 repeated search | identical Grep/Glob `pattern`, or a `Read` within the first [`EARLY_CALLS`] tool calls, after a Grep, Glob or failed Read, of a file the session does not also Edit, Write or MultiEdit | ≥ [`MIN_SESSIONS_SEARCH`] sessions |
//! | S5 repeated error | `is_error: true` text normalised by [`normalise_error`] | identical first [`ERROR_KEY_CHARS`] chars in ≥ [`MIN_SESSIONS_ERROR`] sessions |
//! | S6 task census | sessions per attributed directory, from `claude_session` | always, as a count |
//!
//! A call's key is its command head, its path or its pattern. A call
//! whose input could not be read -- no input object, or none of the
//! fields its tool keys on -- has NO key, never its tool's name (#1420):
//! a `Read` whose input did not parse is not a read of a file called
//! `Read`. It is not an S4 read or search, its S5 finding names no call
//! ("recurring error: `Read`: …", no "on …"), and S2 and S3 group it
//! under its tool alone ("a `Read` call was denied"). A failed one is
//! still looking: an early read after it says "after a failed `Read`
//! (input could not be read)".
//!
//! S1, S2 and S3 are [`Severity::Advice`]: each carries a rule a session
//! had to learn -- the command that worked after the one that failed,
//! the user's stated fix, the call not to make. S4 and S5 are
//! [`Severity::Note`]s: observations, not advice. S5 (#1368), worded
//! "recurring error: `<tool>` on `<key>`: …", shows only that something
//! failed repeatedly, which is often nothing CLAUDE.md wording controls
//! (a sub-agent's schema, a search tool's timeout). An error that a later
//! call in the same session corrected is already S1, and that stays
//! Advice. S4 (#1369) shows where sessions spent their first calls; a CI
//! task that globs `.github/workflows/*.yml` and reads one is doing its
//! job, and nothing links the count to a line a CLAUDE.md could hold. A
//! Note carries no suggestion and no Claudify, and whether its key is
//! already written cannot make it wrong, so an unreadable corpus file
//! leaves it a Note rather than Unknown.
//!
//! Every count states its denominator (#1369): "in 3 of 137 analysed
//! sessions under `<repo>`", qualified "at least 3" while the pass is
//! short. The denominator is in the numerator's unit -- distinct tasks
//! among the analysed sessions -- and is the repository's, so a finding
//! placed on a subdirectory says ", attributed to `<dir>`" rather than
//! implying the sessions ran there.
//!
//! A count is DISTINCT TASKS, never records: distinct sessions, with the
//! sessions that share an opening prompt counted once (#1337), because
//! an automated `claude -p` task replayed seven times is one task, not
//! seven sessions agreeing. The fingerprint is [`task_fingerprint`] of
//! the first user text, stored on the ledger; a session with no opening
//! prompt is its own task, and the finding says how many runs it folded
//! ("3 sessions (9 runs; replays of one task counted once)").
//!
//! `is_error` absent is not `false`: a result that did not say is
//! neither a failure (for A) nor a success (for B), and a test below
//! pins both directions. The
//! thresholds are unvalidated on a real corpus -- this machine holds one
//! session -- and are constants so a corpus can move them without a
//! migration.
//!
//! # Attribution
//!
//! A tool call's absolute `file_path` places the finding on the deepest
//! CLAUDE.md-bearing ancestor directory from the repository scan, else
//! the repository root; a Bash command has no path and attributes to the
//! record's `cwd`. A path inside a linked git worktree of the repository
//! re-roots to the repository: `<wt>/src/a.ts` is `<repo>/src/a.ts` for
//! attribution, and a file path under the repository is keyed relative
//! to it (`src/a.ts`), so the same file read in two worktrees is one key
//! and a finding never names a disposable worktree. A worktree is
//! identified by its `.git` file, not its directory name; [`Worktrees`]
//! carries the rule, including what happens once the worktree has been
//! deleted: a deleted checkout is identified by the sessions' own cwds
//! and the repository's git ignore rules (#1335). A path-keyed finding
//! whose path no longer exists after re-rooting is not advice: it is left
//! out and counted in one coverage [`Severity::Note`] ("N findings named
//! paths that no longer exist"; a count, not advice, #1354). The stored row carries the attributed DIRECTORY,
//! and which CLAUDE.md it maps to is decided at read time against the
//! current scan, so a CLAUDE.md added since the pass moves the finding
//! without a re-read.
//!
//! # Only sessions under the current CLAUDE.md count
//!
//! A session that ran under an older CLAUDE.md says nothing about the
//! current one (#1371). For each finding, only sessions that STARTED
//! (`claude_session.first_seen_at`) at or after the attributed CLAUDE.md
//! last changed count toward the threshold and the denominator; older
//! ones are mentioned, not counted: "3 of 40 analysed sessions under
//! `<repo>` since `CLAUDE.md` last changed on <date> (5 more before
//! it)", and only they are evidence. The dates come from one batched
//! `git status` and one `git log --name-only` over every CLAUDE.md in
//! the scan, per pass ([`versions_of`]); the date is the newest commit's
//! committer time, the moment the change landed in this history.
//!
//! - A finding that reaches its threshold only with older sessions is
//!   held back, and one Note per file counts them ("N findings on
//!   `CLAUDE.md` reach their thresholds only with sessions from before it
//!   last changed on <date>"), each held finding's sentence as evidence.
//!   Never dropped silently. A held finding no current session shows
//!   says so: "in none of 40 analysed sessions … (5 before it)", never
//!   "at least 0" (#1425). "At least" qualifies a count that might be
//!   higher; it is used only for one of 1 or more.
//! - A CLAUDE.md git lists as modified, staged or untracked changed
//!   "now": no session has run under it yet, so every session is older,
//!   and the Note says so.
//! - If git cannot date the file -- no `.git` at the repository, a git
//!   that fails, a file with no commit -- nothing is filtered. Every
//!   session counts, the finding ends "could not tell which version of
//!   `<file>` these sessions ran under", and one Note per file carries
//!   git's words. A session whose start does not parse is counted and
//!   qualified the same way.
//! - A finding placed on a directory with no CLAUDE.md has no version to
//!   filter by, and counts every session.
//!
//! The report cache needs no new input for this. A file's commit date is
//! a function of the history `HEAD` names, which [`super::cache`] hashes
//! (#1334); an uncommitted change is in the `git status` bytes it hashes,
//! and the CLAUDE.md's own bytes are hashed besides. A new or changed
//! session moves its `(size, mtime)`. What is not covered is a session's
//! `first_seen_at` moving earlier without its transcript changing (a
//! late hook row), which can move a session across the line; stated,
//! not hidden. No stored signal row changes, so [`RULE_VERSION`] does
//! not move.
//!
//! # Already written is not a gap
//!
//! Before a finding is emitted its dedup key is tested verbatim, with
//! whitespace collapsed and case kept, against every CLAUDE.md from the
//! repository root to the attributed directory, their resolved imports,
//! the global and local scopes the effective scan carries, each of
//! the repository's `.claude/rules` a session in that directory would
//! load (`claudemd::rules`: unconditional, or `paths:` reaching it), and
//! every skill: `SKILL.md` at any depth under the repository's
//! `.claude/skills` and the user's `~/.claude/skills` (#1370). A path a
//! skill runs is the skill doing its job, and a hit names it: "already
//! written in skill `<name>` (`<path>`)", the name being the directory
//! holding the file. Plugin skills are out of scope; they are not the
//! repository owner's to change. The report cache sees these files
//! through the definitions inventory (one level under each `skills/`)
//! and, for the repository's, through git's HEAD and status; a user
//! skill nested deeper than one level is not a cache input, so editing
//! one alone does not invalidate a cached report. A
//! file that does not exist holds nothing. A file that exists and could
//! not be read, or a rule `claudemd::rules` could not read (whose
//! `paths:` are unknown too), is not "not written" (#1351): when no
//! readable file holds the key, the finding is [`Severity::Unknown`],
//! its sentence ends "whether `<key>` is already written could not be
//! checked", and its evidence names each such file with its io error.
//! Unknown rather than a qualified Advice, because the file that was not
//! read is exactly where the rule would be written: the advice to add it
//! may be wrong, and a possibly-wrong claim is suppressed, not
//! qualified. A hit in a readable file still settles it. A hit is kept visible as a
//! [`Severity::Note`] worded "already written in `<file>`", so the reader
//! sees the rule doing its job without being told to change anything
//! (#1339). A paraphrased rule is missed by
//! this; semantic matching is #1198.
//!
//! # Bounds
//!
//! Sessions are chosen by one query over `claude_session.cwd`; nothing
//! walks the corpus to choose. Each transcript is read to
//! [`BUDGET_BYTES`], reading `limit + 1` bytes so truncation is a fact
//! of the read rather than a stat/read race on a live file (#1213). At
//! most [`SESSIONS_PER_PASS`] transcripts are READ per pass; a session
//! whose `(size_bytes, mtime_ms)` matches `claude_advice_ledger` is
//! served from `claude_advice_signal` without being opened, so a re-open
//! re-reads only what changed. The ledger row also carries
//! [`RULE_VERSION`]; a row from an older extraction rule is a miss, so a
//! rule change re-reads every session once rather than serving rows the
//! new rule would not have stored. This runs on demand behind the panel, on
//! the command's `spawn_blocking`, and never on the live pass (#1246).
//!
//! # Coverage travels as findings
//!
//! The report model has no per-check coverage struct beyond
//! [`super::CheckRun`], so what the spec calls `Coverage` travels here as
//! findings: one [`Severity::Note`] stating "analysed N of M sessions
//! under `<repo>`; K truncated at 8 MB" whenever the pass is short or a
//! read was cut, and one stating "no Claude Code sessions were recorded
//! under `<repo>`" when there are none -- never an empty list, because
//! no sessions is not "nothing went wrong". While the pass is short,
//! every count says "at least". These and the S6 census are Notes: they
//! state what was measured and recommend nothing (#1339). The census's
//! evidence names only the exceptions -- a session with no opening
//! prompt, one read only to the budget, one with no transcript on disk
//! -- because an ordinary session is not evidence of anything (#1425).
//!
//! A session whose transcript is not on disk -- no path recorded, or a
//! path that is `NotFound` because its worktree's project directory was
//! deleted after the merge -- is gone, and says nothing about any
//! CLAUDE.md (#1367). It is counted in that coverage Note ("K had no
//! transcript on disk and were skipped"), with a sample of the sessions
//! as its evidence. A transcript that exists and could not be read
//! (permission, I/O) is different: it might hold a signal. Those are ONE
//! [`Severity::Unknown`] listing the sessions and their io errors, never
//! one row per session, whose brief says what to make readable. Both
//! make the pass short, so the "at least" stays.
//!
//! # Privacy
//!
//! A finding carries keys (a command head, a path, a pattern, a tool
//! name), counts and session ids. User text (S2) and error text (S5, and
//! the failed command's error in S1) appear only in ONE evidence row's
//! `measured`, clamped to [`DETAIL_CHARS`]. Nothing here logs, and
//! nothing leaves the machine.
