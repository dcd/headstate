//! Directories that have a toolchain, tests or role of their own and no
//! CLAUDE.md between them and the root.
//!
//! # The rule, cited
//!
//! Anthropic's memory docs (`code.claude.com/docs/en/memory`, "How
//! CLAUDE.md files load"): files in the directory hierarchy above the
//! working directory load at launch; "files in subdirectories load on
//! demand when Claude reads files in those directories". A convention
//! that lives only in the root file is paid for by every session; one in
//! `crates/foo/CLAUDE.md` is loaded exactly when a session touches
//! `crates/foo/`. A directory with its own build, tests or release
//! process and no CLAUDE.md anywhere between it and the root has no place
//! for that knowledge to live where it costs nothing until needed.
//!
//! # What is measured, and where
//!
//! Every fact comes from [`DirFacts`], which `claudemd::scan_repo` records
//! inside the loop that finds the CLAUDE.md files. There is no second
//! walk: #1236 halved that walk's cost once, and this producer adds one
//! file read per `Cargo.toml` or `package.json` it passes, and one git
//! process per run for what git ignores (below), and nothing else.
//! `packages::detect::ecosystems` was the intended source of the
//! manifest signal and was rejected after reading and measuring it: per
//! directory it lists the directory twice more (`has_project_file`,
//! `has_xcode_spm`) and walks three levels under it for Terraform locks.
//! Measured on this checkout (120 directories): the walk with facts
//! recorded takes 9.7 ms, and calling `ecosystems()` once per listed
//! directory adds 12.1 ms on top -- more than the whole walk, to learn
//! ten ecosystem labels that ten entry names already gave. The
//! manifest's NAME is what a finding prints, and the walk has the name in
//! hand.
//!
//! # Candidate, strong, weak
//!
//! A candidate is a directory, not the root, with at least one signal,
//! no CLAUDE.md on the path from it up to (excluding) the root, no rule
//! whose `paths:` scopes it, and not under a directory git ignores (both
//! below). The root
//! file covers nothing below it by itself, or every repository with one
//! root file would pass. A directory the walk could not list, or anything
//! under one, is never a candidate: it is an Unknown finding instead.
//!
//! Strong signals: a manifest of its own; membership in a workspace;
//! [`TEST_FILE_THRESHOLD`] or more `*.test.*`/`*.spec.*` files directly
//! in it; or being one of the directories sessions edit heavily, when the
//! transcripts producer supplies that list. Weak signals: a well-known
//! role name (`docs`, `scripts`, `crates/*`, …) or a `tests/`,
//! `__tests__/` or `spec/` entry. A directory with only weak signals is a
//! weak candidate: its finding says "role name only" and is a
//! [`Severity::Note`], not advice (#1397). A role name is a statistic
//! about directory names, with no evidence that anything is true only
//! there, which is what a Note is for (#1339): the row says what was
//! measured and its brief recommends nothing. Three or more role-only
//! siblings group into one row, and that row is a Note too.
//!
//! A strong candidate stays [`Severity::Advice`], including one the root
//! file's mention downgraded to weak (below): its manifest, tests or
//! edits are still evidence, and the mention is shown beside them.
//!
//! # The test-file threshold is 10
//!
//! Measured on this checkout, direct `*.test.*` counts per directory:
//! `src/components` 105, `src/lib` 58, `src/api` 33, `scripts` 14,
//! `src/components/stats` 10, `src` 6, `src/store` 5, `src/fixtures` 1.
//! Below ten, every directory is one whose tests are incidental to a
//! parent that a session works in for the parent's sake; from ten up,
//! each is a place a session works in for its own sake, and
//! `src/components/stats` at exactly ten is a feature directory with a
//! suite of its own. A count below the threshold is not a signal at all,
//! rather than a weak one: one test file next to a fixture is not a
//! reason to suggest a file.
//!
//! # Suppressed and downgraded, by the nearest ancestor file
//!
//! For a candidate the nearest ancestor CLAUDE.md is the root's, by
//! construction. If it has a heading naming the directory
//! (`text::sections_naming`), the finding is suppressed: the parent has
//! given it a section, and whether that section should move down is the
//! placement producer's question, not this one's. If it has a heading
//! naming an ancestor of the directory, or a path reference to the
//! directory or something under it (`text::paths_naming`), a strong
//! candidate is downgraded to weak with the line as evidence, and a weak
//! one is dropped: a role name the parent already points at is nothing to
//! say. Both helpers live in `text.rs` and are shared with the placement
//! producer.
//!
//! # Grouping
//!
//! Findings are keyed by parent and signal set, so twelve workspace
//! members under `packages/` are one finding with the member list in its
//! evidence, not twelve. Three or more siblings group; a member with a
//! distinct signal set (one that also holds two hundred tests) stays its
//! own row. Measured on this checkout: 120 directories listed, six
//! CLAUDE.md files, ten manifests, two candidates
//! (`crates/headstate-stepup/` strong and Advice, `docs/` weak and a
//! Note). That ratio is the target.
//!
//! # The edited signal
//!
//! [`gaps`] takes `edited: &[PathBuf]`, the directories sessions edit
//! heavily. The transcripts producer computes it as
//! `transcripts::edited_dirs` from the tool-use paths its pass already
//! stored; this producer never reads a transcript itself. The
//! [`Producer`] impl reads it through `Context::conn`. No store (`None`)
//! is an empty signal and nothing to say: the candidates stand on their
//! other signals, and "no edits recorded" is not "no edits". A store
//! that could not be queried is a [`Severity::Unknown`] finding beside
//! the candidates, never a signal quietly dropped (#1044). A path in
//! the list is matched exactly against the directory, absolute or
//! relative to the root.
//!
//! # A path-scoped rule covers what its `paths:` scope
//!
//! A rule in `.claude/rules/` with `paths:` frontmatter loads when a
//! session reads a matching file, so it is a place for a directory's
//! knowledge as a nested CLAUDE.md is (#1340). A candidate some rule
//! scopes (`claudemd::rules::Rule::scopes`: a pattern that reaches the
//! directory and does not open with `**` or a bare `*`) is covered and
//! no finding. A rule with no `paths:` loads at launch like the root file
//! and covers nothing below it by itself, nor does `**/*.ts`. The glob
//! support is small and documented in `claudemd::rules`. When there are
//! rules, each row says how many were read. When `.claude/rules/` is a
//! directory, even an empty one, each row carries placement's probe of
//! it, and the brief offers a rule whose `paths:` names the directory
//! beside the nested CLAUDE.md, in placement's words and with its
//! lazy-load caveat (#1352, as #1321 did for placement). A directory
//! at the root is offered no rule: a root-wide `paths:` scopes nothing.
//! A rule directory or rule
//! that exists and could not be read withholds every candidate a rule
//! did not already cover, as one [`Severity::Unknown`] naming them: any
//! of them might be covered by the rule that was not read.
//!
//! # A directory git ignores is no candidate
//!
//! A build cache can hold a manifest: `.angular/cache/<version>/<app>/
//! vite/deps/` holds a `package.json`, and was suggested a CLAUDE.md on a
//! real repository (#1377). The walk's `SKIP` names known heavy
//! directories to save walk cost; it cannot name every tool's cache, and
//! adding names to it is not how this is decided. [`ignored_dirs`] asks
//! git once per run (`git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard
//! --directory`, through the worktree scan's runner and its timeout), and
//! a candidate that is, or is under, a listed directory is dropped. A
//! directory git ignores but that holds a tracked file is not listed, so
//! it stays a candidate: tracked content is source.
//!
//! A root with no `.git` has no ignore rules, and git is not asked: the
//! candidates are what they were. A git that could not run, did not
//! answer in time, failed, or answered and complained on stderr leaves
//! every candidate undecided, since any of them might be ignored: they
//! are withheld as one [`Severity::Unknown`] naming them, as an
//! unreadable rule withholds them, never stated as if git had said
//! "nothing is ignored" (#1050).
//!
//! # Deliberately out of scope
//!
//! `AGENTS.md` changes what "covered" means -- it is read only where
//! none of the three CLAUDE.md files exists -- and is not consulted
//! here. Docs linked from a CLAUDE.md by an ordinary markdown link are
//! not coverage: they are not loaded into a session, so they instruct
//! nothing until read. Go's `_test.go` and Python's `test_*.py` are not
//! counted as test files: the pattern is the design's `*.test.*`, and a
//! wider one is a measured change, not a default.
