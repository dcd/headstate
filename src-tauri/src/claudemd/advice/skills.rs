//! Skills alongside CLAUDE.md: frontmatter, cross-references, procedures
//! a skill already holds, and cost.
//!
//! `definitions.rs` inventories every skill across user, project and
//! plugin scope and, by design, parses `name:` and `description:` and
//! nothing else. This producer reads each `SKILL.md` once more, whole,
//! and reports what the inventory cannot: a frontmatter value over a
//! documented limit, a CLAUDE.md naming a skill no scope holds, a
//! CLAUDE.md section that carries a procedure a skill already holds, and
//! what each skill costs.
//!
//! # Two surfaces, and a finding names which one it quotes
//!
//! The two Anthropic documents disagree about what is required, and a
//! finding that merged them would state a rule neither surface has.
//! Claude Code's skills reference (code.claude.com/docs/en/skills, read
//! 2026-09-21): every field is optional; `name` defaults to the
//! directory; `description` defaults to the first non-empty body line;
//! the frontmatter is read only when `---` is the file's first line, and
//! otherwise the whole file, markers included, is content; booleans
//! accept `yes/no/on/off/1/0` in any case; `description` plus
//! `when_to_use` is listed truncated at 1,536 characters; `compatibility`
//! is up to 500. The Agent Skills spec as the API enforces it
//! (platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview):
//! `name` required, at most 64 characters of lowercase letters, digits
//! and hyphens, not containing `anthropic` or `claude`; `description`
//! required, non-empty, at most 1,024 characters, no XML tags. Every
//! limit finding says which of the two it is quoting, and none says a
//! skill WAS rejected: that is not measured here.
//!
//! # The unquoted colon is a warning, not a verdict
//!
//! `description: Use when X: Y` is not a valid YAML 1.2 plain scalar. The
//! spec text that would say what Claude Code does with such a line could
//! not be fetched when this was written (agentskills.io and yaml.org are
//! both behind the egress proxy), and `definitions::frontmatter` accepts
//! the line, so the inventory is no evidence either way. The finding
//! names the line and the YAML rule, and never says "Claude Code will
//! reject this". A block scalar (`description: >-` and the indented
//! lines under it) is not a plain scalar, so a `: ` in one is legal and
//! not this warning.
//!
//! # A block scalar is its indented lines (#1419)
//!
//! `description: >-` is a header, not a value: the value is the
//! more-indented lines under it. Both readers -- `parse_frontmatter`
//! here and `definitions::frontmatter`, whose description the cost Notes
//! and plugin totals measure -- read it through the one
//! `definitions::block_scalar`, which documents what YAML it still does
//! not read. Read as the header, a nine-line description was ~1 est.
//! token "paid by every session".
//!
//! # Rules taken from the skills authoring page
//!
//! platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices,
//! read 2026-09-21, is the source for four more rules, each reported as
//! advice with the page named: keep the SKILL.md body under 500 lines;
//! keep references one level deep from SKILL.md; write the description
//! in the third person (checked narrowly, as a description that begins
//! `I ` or `You `, because anything wider is a judgement about prose);
//! avoid time-sensitive information (checked as an absolute date on the
//! same line as `as of`, `before`, `after` or `until`, the page's own
//! example being "before August 2025").
//!
//! # A plugin's skill is an observation, never advice (#1365)
//!
//! The advice panel is about what this repository's owner can change. A
//! plugin's `SKILL.md` belongs to the plugin's author and lives in the
//! plugin cache, which every update rewrites: 48 rows of advice on one
//! such file, measured on a real machine, were rows the reader could act
//! on only by forking someone else's plugin. So none of the content rules
//! above -- frontmatter, body length, reference depth, dated facts --
//! runs on a skill whose `Source` is `Plugin`, and nothing here emits
//! Advice or Problem about one.
//!
//! What a plugin skill still gets is its cost, in its plugin's
//! description total ("plugin `x`: N skills; ~M est. tokens ... paid by
//! every session"), whose evidence names the plugin's three skills with
//! the most expensive descriptions. That is worth showing whatever its
//! size, because disabling the plugin IS the reader's choice. A plugin
//! skill gets no cost Note of its own (#1425): 95 of them, one per
//! `SKILL.md` across 11 plugins on this repository's own report, buried
//! the few rows worth reading, and none was a choice the reader could
//! make one skill at a time. A plugin skill still counts as held when a CLAUDE.md names it,
//! and still counts when a CLAUDE.md section repeats its commands: both
//! of those findings are about the CLAUDE.md, which is this
//! repository's.
//!
//! # What counts as a procedure (#1423)
//!
//! Any single signal used to be enough, and four of five findings on
//! Headstate's own CLAUDE.md files were not procedures. The signals
//! now, a shell fence that a skill also holds being two of them:
//!
//! - a shell fence of two or more command lines (a one-line fence is an
//!   example);
//! - a fence at least two of whose lines, and at least half, appear in
//!   one skill (one shared line is coincidence, not a duplicate);
//! - a heading starting `Before`, `Gates` or `Releasing`, which only
//!   strengthens: it counts beside overlap, or beside a fence LONGER
//!   than a pair -- two gate commands under `## Gates` are a checklist,
//!   three commands under `## Releasing` a process;
//! - an ordered list of two or more commands, which is enough alone.
//!
//! A finding needs the ordered list, or two signals. A section whose
//! prose already points to a document or skill for the process ("follow
//! it", "see the `x` skill") is delegating, and gives none whatever else
//! it holds: that is what the finding would have recommended.
//!
//! # An absent `name` is not a finding
//!
//! Claude Code names the skill by its directory, and the inventory
//! already records `named_in_frontmatter`. A row for every plugin skill
//! that relies on the default would teach the reader to skim the list.
//!
//! # Usage is not joined, and "no call observed" is not a finding
//!
//! `plugins.rs` reads every `Skill` tool call but attributes it to a
//! plugin: `claude_plugin_scan.calls` holds one `[mcp, skill, agent,
//! command]` tuple per plugin and no per-skill name, so a count for one
//! skill is not readable from the store. The `Option<u64>` the
//! definitions header specifies is therefore `None` for every skill
//! here, and `None` produces no finding at all: "no call observed" is not
//! "unused", and #1207 is what a plain zero did last time.
//!
//! # A cost figure is a Note
//!
//! Each repository or user skill's cost (body lines and est. tokens,
//! description est. tokens) and each scope's description total are
//! [`Severity::Note`]:
//! they state what was measured and recommend nothing, so their brief
//! asks for no edit (#1354). No cost threshold turns one into Advice.
//! The only measured limit on size is the authoring page's 500 body
//! lines, which is its own Advice finding; a figure is never kept as
//! Advice because it is large.
//!
//! # Unknown
//!
//! No inventory at all is `Err`, and the whole check is Unknown. A scope
//! the inventory could not read is one Unknown finding naming it; while
//! any such refusal exists, a skill a CLAUDE.md names that was not found
//! is Unknown ("not found in the scopes that could be read") rather than
//! a Problem, and a count for a scope with a refusal says "at least".
//!
//! Read-only. Nothing here edits a skill or chooses between colliding
//! ones; `definitions.rs` says why the second is not this module's call.
