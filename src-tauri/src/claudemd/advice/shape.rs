//! Content shape: the rules from published guidance that a deterministic
//! check can enforce over one CLAUDE.md or one launch set.
//!
//! The research behind every rule is
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-21-claude-md-practices-research.md`.
//! It marks each source *measured* or *asserted*, and that sets the
//! severity here:
//!
//! - **Behaviour facts** from Claude Code's memory docs
//!   (`code.claude.com/docs/en/memory`) and changelog say what the tool
//!   DOES, and are the only grounds for [`Severity::Problem`].
//! - **Advice** from Anthropic's guidance pages, HumanLayer, Cursor and
//!   the published linters is asserted, not measured, and is
//!   [`Severity::Advice`]. The brief quotes the source; the finding
//!   never predicts an effect.
//! - **Statistics** with no threshold, such as the launch-set row, are
//!   [`Severity::Note`]: they recommend nothing (#1422).
//! - **Measurements.** ETH Zurich (arXiv:2602.11988): context files raise
//!   inference cost by over 20% on average. McMillan (arXiv:2605.10039):
//!   1,650 sessions, file size varied 25 to 500 lines, no detectable
//!   adherence difference. UFMG (arXiv:2606.15828): 91% of 100 popular
//!   repositories carry a content smell; files of 200+ lines in 42%.
//!
//! So a size finding states the cost and Anthropic's target, never
//! "adherence will drop". The bill is measured; the compliance loss is
//! not.
//!
//! # The rules, with source and threshold
//!
//! | rule | source | threshold | severity |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`Rule::LineTarget`] | memory docs "target under 200 lines per CLAUDE.md file"; features-overview "Keep CLAUDE.md under 200 lines"; UFMG's context-bloat threshold | 200 lines. The brief names the community range: 60 (HumanLayer's own root), 300 (HumanLayer's cap), 500 (Cursor rules) | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::LaunchSet`] | memory docs: imported files "still load and enter the context window at launch"; subdirectory files load "when Claude reads files in those subdirectories" | none: one informational row per report, every file loaded before the first prompt with lines and est. tokens; "at least" when the scan is partial. A statistic that recommends nothing (#1422) | Note |
//! | [`Rule::HardSkip`] | memory docs "loads a CLAUDE.md file of up to 4 MiB in full and skips a larger file" | 4 MiB, on-disk bytes | Problem |
//! | [`Rule::Secret`] | cclint's secret rule; changelog: the feedback share uploads "the system prompt (which includes your CLAUDE.md instructions)" | `sk-ant-`, `ghp_`, `github_pat_`, a PEM private-key header, `AKIA` + 16; placeholders (`xxx`, `your`, `example`, one repeated character) skipped. The finding carries the line and a masked prefix, never the value | Problem |
//! | [`Rule::Emphasis`] | best-practices "add emphasis such as 'IMPORTANT' to that line alone. If you emphasize many lines, none of them stands out." | 2 or more prose lines in one file carrying all-caps `IMPORTANT`, `YOU MUST`, `NEVER` or `ALWAYS`. Caps only: bold prose does not count, or this repository's own house style would trip it | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::HookRule`] | memory docs: Claude treats CLAUDE.md as "context, not enforced configuration … use a PreToolUse hook instead"; features-overview "Put guardrails in hooks" | a tool verb (`edit`, `write`, `delete`, `rm`, `commit`, `push`, `force`), any case, in the clause a modal opens: after `never`, `always`, `must not` or `do not` (in any emphasis, `_Never …_` included, #1432), before the next `;` or sentence-ending `.`, `!`, `?` on the same line (#1374). A sentence mark ends the clause when whitespace or the end of the line follows it, directly or after a run of closing `*`, `_`, `` ` ``, `)`, `]`, `"`, `'` or `~`, so `.**`, `._`, `.)` and `."` end a clause and ``**Never work on `main`.** Create a worktree → commit`` is silent (#1421). A tool verb before the modal or in another sentence ("fails any loosening edit. Never loosen a baseline.") is not the rule's verb. Words are read outside inline code spans. A hyphenated compound counts only when every part is a tool verb (`force-push` fires; `slow-write`, `write-ahead` do not), a word directly after `@` is a tag, and a word directly after a determiner, quantifier or possessive (`a`, `an`, `any`, `the`, `each`, `every`, `this`, `that`, `no`, `some`, `my`, `your`, `his`, `her`, `its`, `our`, `their`, `'s`) is a noun. A code span in the clause counts only when it is itself a tool-action command, by its first words: `git <verb>` names the verb, `rm` names `rm`; any other span (`8 write`) names nothing (#1322). Still not parsed: a noun after an adjective ("never make any loosening edit" fires), a verb in a subordinate clause ("always run the gate before you commit" fires), a rule wrapped across lines, `don't`, and an abbreviation's `.` read as a sentence break | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::Conflict`] | memory docs "if two rules contradict each other, Claude may pick one arbitrarily"; UFMG: conflicting instructions in 28% | two files in one launch set whose named package managers (`npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn`/`bun`), lint entry points (`make lint` vs `yarn lint` …) or default branches are non-empty and disjoint | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::TreeListing`] | `/doctor` "cuts content Claude can derive from the codebase, such as directory layouts"; best-practices' exclude table | a fenced block with 3 or more lines starting `├`, `└` or `│` | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::InitSkeleton`] | UFMG: init fossilization in 24%; `/doctor` removes architecture overviews; best-practices "There's no required format" | the `/init` skeleton headings `Project Overview`, `Development Commands` and `Architecture` all present | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::AgentsMd`] | memory docs (2.1.277): with both files present Claude Code reads "Your CLAUDE.md files only"; a CLAUDE.md naming AGENTS.md in prose → "Claude sees AGENTS.md only if it decides to open the file" | `AGENTS.md` beside a repo-scope CLAUDE.md whose imports do not resolve to it | Advice |
//! | [`Rule::LocalNotIgnored`] | memory docs: `CLAUDE.local.md`, "add to `.gitignore`" | `git check-ignore` exits 1 for it | Problem |
//!
//! Rules the research hands to other producers, so they are not
//! unowned: lint leakage to toolchain; blind references and dated facts
//! to rot; duplicate content across scopes and an always-rule in a
//! lazily loaded subdirectory file to placement; import depth and
//! external imports to the imports seed (`advice/imports.rs`); the skills
//! authoring page's rules to skills.
//!
//! # What is read, and how
//!
//! Every CLAUDE.md the scan found -- repo, global and local scope -- is
//! read once here, since [`crate::claudemd::ClaudeFile`] carries no
//! text (it is on the wire, and `claude_md_content` exists so a file's
//! text crosses the bridge only when shown). A file the scan read and
//! this producer cannot is `Err`: the check is Unknown, never clean.
//! Prose rules read through `text::prose_lines`, so a fence and a
//! block-level HTML comment are invisible to them, as they are to Claude
//! (a comment) or are somebody's syntax (a fence). The secret rule reads
//! every raw line, comments and fences included: a secret in a committed
//! file is a secret whatever Claude sees.
//!
//! The launch set is what the memory docs say loads at launch from the
//! repository root: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `./CLAUDE.md`,
//! `./.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `./CLAUDE.local.md`, and each one's resolved
//! import tree. Subdirectory files load only after a Read there and are
//! measured by the per-file rules but not counted here. `.claude/rules/`
//! is not scanned (a non-goal of the design), so a repository that uses
//! it has a launch set larger than this row, which is one reason the
//! row's figures are estimates and say so.
//!
//! # Claude Code's own "too long" warning is not reproduced
//!
//! Its threshold "scales with the model's context window" (changelog
//! 2.1.169), and Headstate cannot know which model a session will use.
//!
//! # Rejected: a required-sections template
//!
//! cclint and carlrannaberg/cclint require `Project Overview`,
//! `Development Commands` and `Architecture`. Anthropic says "There's no
//! required format", `/doctor` deletes architecture overviews, and UFMG
//! names the `/init` skeleton as a smell. So the template's presence is
//! a finding here, and its absence never is.
//!
//! # Measured on this repository (2026-09-21)
//!
//! `CLAUDE.md` 60, `src/CLAUDE.md` 82, `src-tauri/CLAUDE.md` 48,
//! `scripts/CLAUDE.md` 29, `.github/CLAUDE.md` 81 lines; no `@` imports,
//! no `AGENTS.md`, no `CLAUDE.local.md`. Every emphasis in these files
//! is bold prose, not caps. The one line-wrapped "Never work directly on
//! `main`" sentence puts its tool verb on the next line, so the hook
//! rule, which reads one line at a time, is silent on it. The producer
//! emits the launch-set row and nothing else here; the `#[ignore]`d
//! test at the bottom prints the report so the figure can be re-taken.
