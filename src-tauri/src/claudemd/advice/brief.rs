//! The brief: markdown an agent can be handed for one finding, and the
//! combined document for a whole report.
//!
//! Headstate never edits a CLAUDE.md. The brief is the hand-off, in the
//! shape `packages::markdown` already renders for outdated dependencies:
//! what was found, where, what was measured, and what to change -- ending
//! with the `assess.rs` idiom that keeps the agent read-only until the
//! user has seen a diff.
//!
//! # Paths are printed as the finding carries them
//!
//! Absolute, because `ClaudeFile::path` is absolute and the global scope's
//! file lives outside the repository, where a relative path would have
//! nothing to be relative to. An agent given an absolute path can open it
//! from any working directory.
//!
//! # The match on [`Check`] has no wildcard arm
//!
//! `rustc` refuses a missing arm, so the defect a guard can catch is a
//! `_ =>` that would let a new variant compile with a generic suggestion.
//! `invariants.rs` scans this file, with comment lines stripped, and fails
//! on one. Every producer therefore writes its own suggestion.
