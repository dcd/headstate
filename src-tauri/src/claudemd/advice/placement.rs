//! Content in the wrong file: a CLAUDE.md section whose named paths all
//! fall under one subdirectory, plus the two rules the content-shape
//! research hands here -- a run of lines duplicated between two files one
//! session loads, and an all-caps rule in a file that loads lazily.
//!
//! # The cost model is Claude Code's, not ours
//!
//! The memory docs, verbatim: "CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md files in the
//! directory hierarchy above the working directory are loaded at launch.
//! Files in subdirectories load on demand when Claude reads files in
//! those directories." A root section that is entirely about
//! `packages/api/` costs every session in the repository its tokens; the
//! same text in `packages/api/CLAUDE.md` costs only the sessions that
//! read there. Imports do not help: "imported files still load and enter
//! the context window at launch".
//!
//! # Where a section points, never where its rule applies
//!
//! The heuristic reads which paths a section names. From paths alone it
//! cannot know whether the rule those paths illustrate applies only
//! there -- a rule for every component author whose implementation
//! happens to live in `src/lib/` looks the same as a rule about
//! `src/lib/`. The identifiers the section names are the one signal it
//! does read about that (below). Otherwise the finding says "names only
//! paths under" and never "belongs in", the severity is
//! [`Severity::Advice`], and the reader decides.
//!
//! # A section its callers need stays put
//!
//! One signal about where a rule applies is measurable (#1398): the
//! identifiers a section names. A section naming `src/lib/useIsMobile.ts`
//! and `src/lib/target.ts` names only paths under `src/lib/`, but it is
//! about `useIsMobile()` and `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`, which those files define
//! and code all over `src/` calls. Moving it into `src/lib/` would load
//! it only when a session opens the definitions, which is exactly when
//! nobody needs it.
//!
//! So before a "names only paths under X" finding is emitted, the
//! section's code-span identifiers (`refs`' symbols: calls, qualified
//! names and SCREAMING_CASE, by their last segment) are searched for as
//! whole words, with rot's symbol search: its source roots plus the
//! directories of the repository's CLAUDE.md files, one walk for the
//! whole run. If any searched source file OUTSIDE X uses one, the
//! section is guidance for callers and there is no finding. A section
//! with no identifiers is judged by its paths alone, as before; one whose
//! names are used only inside X is a finding, and says how many files
//! were searched. A walk that read nothing, or could not read everything
//! and found no use outside, cannot settle it: the finding stands,
//! qualified in its evidence and its suggestion, never suppressed on a
//! guess. A use that was read does suppress, whatever else could not be
//! read. A section in a file outside the repository is not searched for:
//! the repository's source says nothing about it.
//!
//! The search is whole-word, not semantic: a common name (`run`) used
//! outside X for something else also suppresses. That errs toward
//! silence, which is the cheaper mistake for advice.
//!
//! # Resolution is against two places, never by suffix
//!
//! A candidate resolves against the file's own directory, then the
//! repository root, with `is_file() || is_dir()`. Never by suffix search:
//! this repository's root file names `claude/cli.rs:128`, which exists
//! only under `src-tauri/src/`, and a suffix search would file a
//! repo-wide rule under `src-tauri`, the wrong answer. That path is
//! reported as not found from this file and does not vote.
//!
//! # Votes, and what suppresses a finding
//!
//! Each resolved path votes for its first segment below the file's
//! directory; a file at the file's own level (`CLAUDE.md`, `Makefile`)
//! votes stay; a path outside the file's directory votes elsewhere; a
//! path that does not resolve is listed and does not vote. A finding
//! needs at least two distinct resolved paths, one segment carrying every
//! vote, that segment an existing directory, and no stay or elsewhere
//! vote. Measured on this repository's own files: a repo-wide section that
//! names `src-tauri/`, `src/` and `src-mobile/` spreads its votes; a seam
//! section naming `src-tauri/src/remote/surface.rs` beside
//! `src-mobile/src/surface.rs` casts an elsewhere vote; a rule with one
//! example path is under the floor. All three are suppressed, and the
//! root file scores clean, which the design requires.
//!
//! # Patterns vote for what they spell literally
//!
//! A token with `<placeholder>` segments or `{a,b}` braces is a path
//! pattern, which `refs` does not classify as a path; dropping it
//! silently claimed "only" on an incomplete set (#1373). The handling is
//! confined to this module, so rot and skills read `refs` unchanged.
//! Braces expand one level into ordinary candidates (`tools/{a,b}.mjs`
//! is `tools/a.mjs` and `tools/b.mjs`). A `<placeholder>` segment votes
//! for its literal prefix as a directory (`apps/<app>/x.json` votes
//! `apps/`), never for anything under the placeholder. A path-shaped
//! token that still cannot be judged -- a placeholder with no literal
//! prefix, nested, unbalanced or comma-less braces -- means the section
//! is not "only" anything, and the finding is suppressed. `<…>` that is
//! not a well-formed `<name>` segment (HTML, generics) is not a pattern
//! and is ignored, as before. Globs (`*`) are not read as patterns.
//!
//! The suggestion also says what a path-scoped placement fits: guidance
//! tied to editing those files, not a rule for a situation such as "when
//! a check fails". It is said, not detected.
//!
//! # A repository with path-scoped rules is offered one
//!
//! A nested CLAUDE.md is not the only lazily loaded target: a rule in
//! `.claude/rules/` with `paths:` frontmatter loads when a session reads
//! a matching file. A repository that keeps such a directory may have
//! retired nested CLAUDE.md files on purpose, so when the repository's
//! `.claude/rules/` is a directory the suggestion offers a rule whose
//! `paths:` names `<dir>/**`, beside the nested file when it exists and
//! instead of it when it does not (#1321). The finding itself is
//! unchanged: the token cost it measures is real either way. Both targets
//! load lazily, so the suggestion keeps the caveat that the content does
//! not hold before a session reads a file there. Only the directory's
//! existence is read, never the rules in it. A probe that fails with
//! anything but not-found is not "no rules directory": the current
//! wording stands and the brief says the question could not be checked.
//! A file outside the repository is not probed. The probe and the rule's
//! wording are `pub(crate)` and shared with the gaps check (#1352), so
//! the two agree on whether a repository uses path-scoped rules.
//!
//! # Not found is not Unknown
//!
//! A path that does not exist has nothing to place, so it is listed and
//! the section is still judged (`imports.rs` keeps the same distinction).
//! A metadata error while resolving -- a permission wall under a named
//! path -- is [`Severity::Unknown`] for that section with the io error as
//! evidence: never a finding, never silence. A file the scan listed but
//! this producer could not read is Unknown for the whole file.
//!
//! # The two handed rules
//!
//! **Duplicate content across scopes.** A run of three or more identical
//! non-blank lines, whitespace collapsed, between two files a session
//! loads together: the root file and a subdirectory file, the user's
//! `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and a project file, `CLAUDE.local.md` and
//! `CLAUDE.md`. Two subdirectory files are not paired: no session loads
//! both at launch. The subject is the narrower file, because every
//! session that loads it also loads the other.
//!
//! **An always-rule in a lazily loaded file.** An all-caps `NEVER`,
//! `ALWAYS`, `IMPORTANT` or `YOU MUST` on a prose line of a subdirectory
//! CLAUDE.md. The finding states the loading fact from Claude Code's
//! docs: such a file loads only after a Read in its directory, not at
//! launch, not on Write, and not for the Explore and Plan agents. Whether
//! the rule needs to hold before that is the reader's call.
//!
//! # A brief is rendered from the finding alone
//!
//! `brief::render` runs at construction with nothing but the [`Finding`],
//! so what the suggestion needs travels in it: the target `CLAUDE.md` and
//! whether it exists is a `Locator::File` evidence entry with no line,
//! as is the repository's `.claude/rules` directory when the probe found
//! it or failed (absent, it is no entry). The token figure and the
//! directory for a rule's `paths:` glob are read back from the finding
//! sentence this module wrote. A value that cannot be read back is
//! omitted, never guessed.

The React 19 + TypeScript frontend.

## `useIsMobile()` vs `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`

Two different questions, routinely confused:

- **`useIsMobile()`** (`src/lib/useIsMobile.ts`) — a *layout* question. Is the
  viewport narrow? True in a resized desktop window.
- **`IS_MOBILE_BUILD`** (`src/lib/target.ts`) — a *capability* question. Is this
  the iOS build? Decides whether a command exists at all.

`src/lib/target.ts` argues the distinction at length. Read it before reaching
for either; the file exists because getting it wrong is easy.
