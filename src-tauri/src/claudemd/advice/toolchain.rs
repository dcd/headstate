//! Toolchain coverage: which build systems are on disk, and which of
//! build, test, lint, format, run and deploy no loaded CLAUDE.md names a
//! command for.
//!
//! # Detection wraps `packages::detect`, and does not extend it
//!
//! `packages::Ecosystem` is the Packages page's contract: `program()`,
//! `update_hint()`, and `run::check_repo` spawning one tool per variant.
//! `Make`, `Just` and `Go` must not join it, so [`Toolchain`] wraps the
//! ecosystems `detect::projects` already finds and adds the markers that
//! page has no use for: `Makefile`/`justfile` targets, `go.mod`,
//! `Gemfile`, Gradle, an Xcode bundle whether or not SPM is resolved, and
//! a `pyproject.toml` no recognised tool owns.
//!
//! An Xcode project under `<app>/gen/apple`, or a Gradle build under
//! `<app>/gen/android`, where `<app>` holds a Tauri config
//! (`tauri.conf.json`, `tauri.conf.json5` or `Tauri.toml`), is not a
//! toolchain (#1396). It is the project `tauri ios init` or `tauri android
//! init` generates, and the Tauri CLI drives it (`tauri ios build`);
//! nobody runs `xcodebuild` on it directly, so offering `xcodebuild build`
//! for it was a gap nobody could close. The rule is exactly Tauri's
//! documented layout and no wider: a hand-made Xcode project elsewhere,
//! or a `gen/apple` with no Tauri config beside `gen`, is still detected.
//!
//! Two of `detect.rs`'s helpers swallow read errors (`has_xcode_spm` and
//! `has_project_file` return `false` when `read_dir` fails, and an
//! unreadable `pyproject.toml` with no lockfile falls through to nothing).
//! Every marker here is read through this module's own walk and reads,
//! which record the io error: a manifest that could not be read is a
//! [`Severity::Unknown`] finding carrying that error, never a shorter
//! list (absent is not zero, #846).
//!
//! # "Documented" means "named"
//!
//! A verb is named when a backtick span or a fenced-block line, read
//! through `text::spans` and `text::fences`, has the manager as its first
//! token followed by a target, script or subcommand that maps to the verb.
//! Prose never counts. Both directions of error are real on this very
//! repository: `make lint` at `CLAUDE.md:13` is an inline span, so a
//! fenced-only matcher would call lint undocumented; the same line names
//! `yarn lint` in order to say *not* that, so the wording is "names",
//! never "recommends". A manager token inside a path (`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`)
//! fails the first-token rule and counts for nothing.
//!
//! Leading `NAME=value` environment assignments are skipped before the
//! first token, as in a script body (#1412: `CI=1 yarn test` names yarn's
//! test). For `make` and `just` the target is the first positional word:
//! options are skipped, and so is the value of one that takes a value
//! (`-C dir`, `-f file`, `--justfile file`, a number after `-j`), so
//! `make -j4 lint` names lint and `make -C lint` names nothing. A target
//! run with `-C` or `-f` names its verb, but its recipe is not followed
//! (below).
//!
//! The files searched are every CLAUDE.md the scan loaded, their imports,
//! and the repository's `.claude/rules/*.md` (`claudemd::rules`, #1340),
//! path-scoped or not: a rule loads when a session works where its
//! `paths:` point, as a nested CLAUDE.md does. So are the skills
//! (`claudemd::skill_files`, #1394): every `SKILL.md` under the
//! repository's `.claude/skills` and the user's `~/.claude/skills`, the
//! walk the transcripts producer's "already written" corpus uses (#1370).
//! A gate documented in a skill the root CLAUDE.md points at is
//! documented; plugin skills are out of scope (#1365). The sentence counts
//! the three apart ("none of the 7 files read, 2 rules or 4 skills names
//! …"). A file two CLAUDE.md files both import is one file read, not two
//! (#1350). Docs linked from a CLAUDE.md by an ordinary markdown link are
//! not searched: they are not loaded into a session, so they instruct
//! nothing until read.
//!
//! The target-to-verb map is by name (`test*`, `lint*`, `fmt*|format*`,
//! `build*`, `dev|run|start|serve`, `deploy|release|publish`). A target
//! that maps to nothing is listed as "other" in the evidence and is never
//! counted for or against a verb.
//!
//! A package.json script whose name maps to nothing is mapped by its body
//! instead (#1341: a `verify` script running prettier, eslint and vitest
//! was listed as "other", and format reported undocumented). The body is
//! split at `&&`, `||`, `;` and `|`, leading `NAME=value` assignments are
//! skipped, a launcher is read through, and the tool maps: `prettier` and
//! `biome format` to format, `eslint` and `biome lint` to lint, `vitest`,
//! `jest`, `mocha` and `playwright test` to test, `tsc` and `vite build`
//! to build. A command running another script (`npm run <s>`) maps `<s>`
//! by name, else by its body, one level only. One script can offer
//! several verbs, and a loaded file naming it names all of them.
//!
//! The same tool map reads a binary a loaded file runs through a manager
//! (#1392): `yarn vitest run`, `npx prettier --check .`, `pnpm exec
//! eslint`, `bunx tsc`, `yarn dlx`, `bun x`, and `yarn|pnpm|bun [run]
//! <bin>`. This reverses #1341's decision that the map applies to bodies
//! only ("`npx prettier` in a CLAUDE.md still names nothing"): on this
//! repository `src/CLAUDE.md` names `yarn vitest run`, which is what the
//! `test` script runs, and the test gap it produced was false. A command
//! that runs a tool directly names what that tool does. The command is
//! credited to the manager that ran it (`npx`, `yarn`), so it covers the
//! JS family's verb and no other toolchain's. A script of the same name
//! takes precedence (`yarn test` is the script, and `yarn vitest` runs a
//! script called `vitest` when one exists); `npm run` runs scripts only;
//! a manager's own subcommand (`yarn install`) names nothing.
//!
//! A body that runs a repository script file (`bash <file>`, `sh <file>`,
//! `node <file>`, `./<file>`) is followed into it one level (#1376: a
//! `verify` running `bash tools/verify.sh`, which ran prettier, was
//! reported as naming no format command). The file resolves against the
//! package's directory and must stay under the repository, checked
//! lexically and again through symlinks; one outside it is never read.
//! Its non-comment lines (`#`, `//`) are read with the same tool map, and
//! a file it runs in turn is not followed. Lines are read by their first
//! words, so a tool a `node` file spawns from inside a JS expression is
//! not found. A file that could not be read, or lies outside the
//! repository, makes that script's verbs Unknown, not uncovered: a gap a
//! loaded file naming the script might cover is a [`Severity::Unknown`]
//! finding naming the file, and the script is not listed as "other". A
//! script nothing names changes nothing. A script file is followed from a
//! package.json body only: a make recipe running one (`./scripts/x.sh`)
//! maps by its first word, which names nothing.
//!
//! A make or just target a loaded file names also names what its recipe
//! runs (#1393: `make lint` ran `cargo clippy` through `lint-rust`, and
//! the cargo lint gap was reported anyway). `packages::scripts` reads each
//! target's prerequisites and recipe lines from the file the target was
//! parsed from; the target is followed through its prerequisites and any
//! recipe line calling the same manager (`$(MAKE) <t>`, `make <t>`, `just
//! <t>`), recursively, each target once. `-C`, `-f` and `--justfile` point
//! at another file, which is not followed. Each recipe command is mapped
//! as a loaded file's would be, split at `&&`, `||`, `;` and `|`, with
//! `NAME=value` assignments and shell keywords (`do`, `then`) skipped: `cd
//! a && cargo clippy` is cargo's lint and `yarn vitest run` yarn's test. A
//! makefile variable assigned a literal (`CARGO := cargo`) is read; a
//! command still starting with any other variable reference is not a
//! literal and is skipped. A target named for a verb credits that verb
//! and no other, to the toolchain each command runs: a command counts when
//! it maps to that verb or to none (`yarn knip` under `lint` is yarn's
//! lint), and a typecheck (`tsc`) under a lint target is lint. A command
//! mapping only to another verb counts for nothing: on this repository
//! `make lint` runs `lint-ui`, whose `yarn tsc -b` the tool map calls
//! build, and a lint target does not document how to build the app, so
//! crediting it would hide the build gap (a false negative, the defect
//! #1393 fixed turned around). A target named for no verb (`verify`,
//! `check`) credits whatever each command maps to: `tsc -b && vitest`
//! there is build and test. A recipe reaching a target
//! the file does not define is reaching a file, unless the makefile is
//! open-ended (`scripts::makefile_is_open_ended`: an `include` or a `%`
//! pattern rule), when that target might be defined where the parser
//! cannot see: the gaps the named target might cover are
//! [`Severity::Unknown`], naming the target, for every toolchain. So are
//! they when whether the makefile is open-ended could not be read (#1411):
//! the Unknown names the makefile and the io error, because a failed read
//! is not a closed makefile. A target name two makefiles share takes the
//! union of what either runs.
//!
//! A JS launcher is read through to the tool it runs (#1323): `npx`,
//! `bunx`, `pnpm exec`, `bun x` and `pnpm nx` name what follows them, and
//! `pnpm`/`bun` run scripts as `yarn` does. An `nx` command's verbs come
//! from its targets by the same name map: `run web:test`, `web:test`,
//! `nx test web`, or `affected`/`run-many` with `-t lint,test`.
//!
//! # Which named command covers which toolchain
//!
//! A verb is covered for a toolchain when a command naming it is run by
//! one of that toolchain's own managers, with two widenings. `npm` and
//! `yarn` accept the whole JS family (`npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`,
//! `npx`, `bunx`, `nx`), which run the same scripts and tools. `make` and
//! `just` accept any manager: a target fronts some other tool, so once
//! anything names the verb the target is an alternative, not a gap. The
//! widening stops there on purpose: `cargo test` covers `make test`, but
//! never a package.json `test` script, because a Rust suite being named
//! says nothing about whether the JS suite is.
//!
//! A binary a JS manager runs (#1392) is credited to that manager, so
//! `npx prettier` covers the JS family's format and nothing else. What a
//! named target's recipe runs (#1393) is credited to the manager that
//! runs it in the recipe, not to `make`: `make lint` reaching `cargo
//! clippy` covers cargo's lint, as `cargo clippy` named directly would,
//! and make's own lint by name as before. Which verb it credits is the
//! target's own when its name has one (above).
//!
//! # One finding per verb
//!
//! Each uncovered verb is one finding, listing every toolchain that offers
//! it and nothing covers (#1395): on this repository `make dev` is `yarn
//! tauri dev`, which builds and runs the Rust side, and `yarn dev`, `cargo
//! run` and `make dev` were three findings for one workflow. The sentence
//! names each toolchain with only the members offering the verb ("cargo
//! (Cargo.toml at src-tauri) offers `run`"), then what each offers, then
//! every command nothing names; the evidence cites each offer where it was
//! found. Only the scripts, targets or subcommands for that verb are
//! listed, not everything a toolchain offers (#1376). Whether a toolchain
//! is covered is still decided per toolchain, by the rule above; this
//! changes only how the uncovered ones are grouped. A toolchain whose
//! negative cannot be decided is not folded into the Advice finding: the
//! same verb gets a second, [`Severity::Unknown`], finding for those.
//!
//! `cargo run` is offered only for a crate with a binary target:
//! `src/main.rs`, `src/bin/`, or `[[bin]]` in `Cargo.toml`. A library
//! crate cannot be run.
//!
//! # A negative needs a complete scan
//!
//! A positive ("`make lint` is named at `CLAUDE.md:13`") stands whatever
//! else was unreadable. A negative ("nothing names `make build`") is an
//! [`Severity::Advice`] finding only when every file a session would load
//! was read: no unreadable scope, directory or file in the scan, no
//! unreadable import, no file this producer failed to re-read, no
//! `.claude/rules` directory or rule that exists and could not be read,
//! and no skills directory or `SKILL.md` that exists and could not be
//! read (#1394). Otherwise the verb's finding is [`Severity::Unknown`],
//! naming what could not be read. `skipped_dirs` qualifies nothing; it is
//! a documented exclusion.
//!
//! No toolchain found is no finding. The report already says "nothing
//! found" only when the check ran, and `detect::projects` stops at depth
//! 3, so even that is a bounded claim this module adds nothing to.
//!
//! # Lint leakage, handed here by the content-shape research
//!
//! A CLAUDE.md line stating a code-style setting (indent width, quotes,
//! semicolons, trailing commas, line length, import order) while a
//! formatter config that sets that setting exists in the repository is a
//! second kind of finding under this check: the formatter already decides
//! it, and a line that restates it is a line the model can get wrong. The
//! survey behind the rule found it in 62% of 100 popular repositories.
//! Matching is deliberately narrow: an explicit setting, never the word
//! "style". The finding's sentence opens with `line N states`, which is
//! how [`suggestion`] tells the two kinds apart.
