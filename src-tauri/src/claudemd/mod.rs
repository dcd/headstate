//! CLAUDE.md files and the tree of files they import.
//!
//! Read-only. Nothing here writes to a file, so a wrong render costs a
//! confused reader rather than a corrupted config.
//!
//! The import resolution is the actual work; everything else is a file
//! browser. Scanning one real code root found 67 CLAUDE.md files and
//! exactly ONE import in use, so the resolver is written from the syntax
//! rather than from what happened to exist locally.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to GitHub.
//!
//! ## Advice
//!
//! `advice/` is OPINION about these files and `claude/confighealth.rs` is
//! not. `confighealth.rs:16-30` rules that module's findings are "CHECKS,
//! never opinions … no heuristic, no style judgement", and a text match
//! for `make test` is a heuristic by construction. So advice lives here
//! as a sibling with a third severity, `Severity::Advice`, and
//! `confighealth` stays what it is. `text.rs` and `refs.rs` are the
//! parsers the advice producers share, landed with the model so no
//! producer writes its own.

/// finds **all 42 files while listing 9,682 directories instead of
/// 22,265** -- 57% fewer, zero files lost.
