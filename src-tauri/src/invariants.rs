//! Rules this codebase already states, asserted over its own source.
//!
//! # Why this module exists (#854)
//!
//! Six parallel audits of v5.13.0 produced about fifty findings, and the
//! thing every auditor noticed independently was that almost none was a
//! conceptual gap. The security auditor put it best: *"In every case the
//! correct implementation already exists elsewhere in this same codebase,
//! usually with a doc comment explaining the threat. None of these are
//! conceptual gaps in the authors' understanding; they are places a known
//! rule was not propagated to a sibling."*
//!
//! Fifty patches fix fifty instances and prevent none. The rule was
//! known every time -- written down, often measured -- and it still did
//! not reach the sibling, so the fifty-first arrives next release. What
//! closes that is a test that fails the moment the sibling is written.
//!
//! # Why the checks here are source scans
//!
//! Each property below is a statement about EVERY call site rather than
//! about observable behaviour at one of them. A behavioural test proves
//! the mechanism works -- which is rarely the thing in doubt -- while
//! saying nothing about the next call site somebody adds. That argument
//! is not new here: `stats::fetch`'s
//! `every_stats_read_goes_through_the_process_wide_permit` makes it at
//! length, and `stats::budget`'s `every_stats_query_meters_itself` is the
//! model this module follows throughout.
//!
//! # Derived, not enumerated
//!
//! The one hard lesson of #844, #842 and #847 is that a hand-written list
//! cannot cover the item nobody remembered to add to it -- all three
//! defects were exactly that, and #844's metering guard found two
//! uncovered documents the moment it stopped naming six. So every scan
//! here DISCOVERS its subjects:
//!
//! - the files, by walking the crate tree at runtime rather than by
//!   `include_str!` on a fixed list, so a brand-new file is covered
//!   without anyone remembering to add it. `include_str!` is the existing
//!   idiom and it is the one thing it cannot do: `every_query_document`
//!   names two paths, which is why `stats/tree.rs`' two documents sit
//!   outside it to this day.
//! - the call sites, by scanning that text.
//!
//! # What a source scan cannot see, stated rather than glossed
//!
//! These limits are real and shared by every check below:
//!
//! - **It cannot follow a call.** A check performed in a helper is
//!   invisible, so where a guard would otherwise report a defect at a
//!   location that does not have one, it offers a NAMED exemption with a
//!   recorded reason rather than a loose pattern.
//! - **It reads text, not semantics.** `"remove_dir_all"` inside a string
//!   literal or a doc comment looks like a call. Comment lines are
//!   skipped explicitly for that reason.
//! - **It sees only this crate tree.** A removal performed by a
//!   dependency, or through `std::process::Command`, is outside every
//!   check here.
//! - **It cannot prove a check is CORRECT**, only that one is present.
//!   `symlink_metadata` called and its answer ignored would pass. The
//!   behavioural tests beside each gate are what cover that, and they
//!   are cited from the checks that depend on them.
//!
//! A guard that cries wolf gets disabled -- `check-privacy.sh:120`
//! records ~40 false positives from one unanchored pattern as the reason
//! every pattern in it is anchored. So each check here prefers an
//! explicit, commented allowlist over a broader regex, and every entry in
//! one says why it is there.

    /// Brace-counting was written first and was wrong, which is worth

    /// codebase rather than by luck: `cargo fmt --check` runs on all
    /// three crates in `make lint`, so every top-level item begins at
    /// column 0 and everything inside a module is indented. A
    /// `#[cfg(test)]` item therefore ends at the next line that starts
    /// with a non-space, non-`}` character.
    ///
    /// Column 0 alone is not enough, which was the second wrong version:
    /// `scan.rs`' `SAMPLE` fixture is a line-continuation string literal
    /// whose CONTENT starts at column 0 (`worktree /home/u/code/...`),
    /// and that ended the test module 5,000 lines early. So the

    // ---- Invariant 2: refs reaching a git argv ---------------------------

    /// Every reader of `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` validates what it got.
    ///
    /// # What it enforces
    ///
    /// A production function that asks git for `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
    /// must pass the answer through `is_safe_ref` before returning it.
    ///
    /// # Why this shape, and not the one #854 asked for
    ///
    /// #854 states the invariant as "every ref or name reaching a
    /// `git`/`docker` argv is behind a flag-shape validator or a `--`".
    /// That was written as a PER-SINK rule, and this codebase deliberately
    /// rejected the per-sink form. `is_safe_ref`'s own doc comment says
    /// so: validation is done "at the BOUNDARIES where remote-controlled
    /// refs enter ... rather than at each of the ten call sites, because a
    /// boundary cannot be forgotten. The `--` separators at the sinks are
    /// the second layer, not the only one."
    ///
    /// A guard demanding a validator or a `--` at each of roughly forty
    /// `git` spawn sites would therefore report the architecture as the
    /// defect. It would fire on `merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD <default>`,
    /// which is correct by construction -- the ref was validated at its
    /// boundary and git's own `merge-base` takes no `--` -- and on
    /// `config --get branch.<b>.remote`, where the name is embedded in a
    /// prefix and cannot be read as a flag at all. Dozens of findings,
    /// none of them real. That is the unanchored-pattern mistake
    /// `check-privacy.sh:120` records forty false positives from, and a
    /// gate that cries wolf is a gate someone disables.
    ///
    /// So the invariant is asserted where the codebase actually places it:
    /// at the boundary. The property "a remote-controlled ref is validated
    /// as it enters" is the one that makes every downstream sink safe, and
    /// it is checkable precisely because the boundaries are few and
    /// identifiable by the ref they read.
    ///
    /// # The finding it catches (#854)
    ///
    /// FOUR functions named `default_branch` read
    /// `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, and before #854 exactly ONE validated
    /// it -- `worktrees::scan::default_branch`, which carries the
    /// reasoning in its own comment: *"`origin/HEAD` is written by the
    /// remote, so the short name it yields is validated BEFORE the
    /// `origin/` prefix is put back on. Prefixing first would hide
    /// `--output=EVIL` behind a name that no longer starts with `-`."*
    ///
    /// `branches::scan`, `packages::apply` and `docker::classify` each
    /// grew their own and returned the name unvalidated. It then reached
    /// `rev-list <default>`, `merge-base <branch> <default>` and
    /// `merge-base --is-ancestor <tag> <default>` as a bare argv element
    /// with no `--`, where `--output=/path` is an arbitrary file write
    /// with the app's privileges.
    ///
    /// The reach of the validator was the mechanism of the failure:
    /// `is_safe_ref` was `pub(super)`, so the other three modules could
    /// not call it even had they wanted to. A shared rule only one module
    /// can see is a rule with one user.
    ///
    /// # What it cannot see
    ///
    /// - **Every other remote-controlled value.** This asserts ONE
    ///   boundary, the one with four implementations and three defects.
    ///   `parse_porcelain`'s branch names are the other, guarded and
    ///   tested since it was written. A tag read from a docker image
    ///   label (`docker::origin`) is a third, gated by `looks_like_sha`
    ///   instead -- a stricter check, not a missing one.
    /// - **Whether the validation is correctly ORDERED** -- only that it
    ///   is ordered at all. `symbolic-ref --short` returns
    ///   `origin/<name>`, so `is_safe_ref` on the PREFIXED string is
    ///   worthless: `origin/--output=/tmp/x` begins with `o`. This is not
    ///   hypothetical. Two of the three fixes #854 wrote made exactly that
    ///   mistake, and this guard passed on both -- it was the behavioural
    ///   test `a_flag_shaped_remote_head_is_refused` that caught them. So
    ///   the assertion below also requires a prefix strip in the same
    ///   function, which narrows the hole without closing it: a strip of
    ///   the wrong prefix, or of the right one applied to the wrong value,
    ///   still passes. The per-site behavioural tests are what cover that,
    ///   and they are named here so the pairing is not accidental.
    /// - **The sinks themselves.** A new `git` call passing an
    ///   unvalidated ref from somewhere else entirely is outside this.
    ///   That is the per-sink question, and it is the one judged
    ///   unenforceable above.

    ///
    /// # The finding it would have caught (#868)
    ///
    /// `observed_test_lock`'s doc comment has said *"One lock for every
    /// TEST that touches `OBSERVED_REMAINING`, directly or through
    /// `Budget::record`"* since #843, and six tests IN THAT SAME FILE
    /// called `record` without it: three in `tests` and three in
    /// `metering`. `record` stores to the process-wide static at
    /// `budget.rs:329` and `cargo test` runs test functions on a thread

    /// `a_seeded_budget_can_actually_refuse`, which reads it. MEASURED: 4
    /// failures in 6 local runs of `cargo test --lib github::stats::budget`,
    /// and one failure on `main` that blocked the v5.14.0 tag.
    ///
    /// The rule had already been propagated ACROSS a file boundary --
    /// `fetch.rs`'s `a_wave_is_refused_once_the_budget_is_under_the_reserve`
    /// takes the lock, and the doc cites that as the reason the lock is
    /// crate-visible rather than private. So a known rule, enforced once
    /// against a different file, failed to reach six siblings in its own.
    /// That is this module's founding observation (#854) recurring inside
    /// the code the audit added, which is why #869 asked for it

    /// # Why reachability rather than a grep for `record`

    /// `observed_test_lock` states the rule in the form a future author
    /// will get wrong: *"`record` is not the only reachable path, and 'my
    /// test does not mention `note_remaining`' is not the question. The
    /// question is whether anything it calls can store to
    /// `OBSERVED_REMAINING`."* Four production functions reach the static
    /// without naming it -- `client::fetch_viewer`,
    /// `client::fetch_viewer_metered`, `client::fetch_prs_with_total` and
    /// `fetch::read_metered` -- so a grep for the two names misses any test
    /// that goes through one of them. None does today, because all four are
    /// `async` and need a live client; the guard covers them so the first
    /// one that appears fails here rather than in a release.
    ///
    /// # The async gap this guard cannot close, and what does
    ///
    /// This rule is enforceable only for SYNC tests. `observed_test_lock`
    /// returns a `std::sync::MutexGuard`, and clippy's
    /// `await_holding_lock` under `-D warnings` refuses to let one be held
    /// across an `.await` -- so an async test structurally cannot comply,
    /// and this guard cannot demand it.
    ///
    /// That gap produced three defects: #1048 (a mock fixture supplying
    /// `rateLimit.remaining`), #1050 (seeding through `record`), and #1079
    /// (an async test inheriting a STARVED figure and failing with a
    /// message about a budget it never set, which burned the v5.22.0 tag).
    ///
    /// `budget::scoped` (#1079) is the async-safe form: a thread-local
    /// override, sound because `cargo test` gives each test its own thread
    /// and every `#[tokio::test]` here uses the default `current_thread`
    /// runtime. An async test calls `scoped::enter` and is then immune to
    /// what any other test wrote -- and its own writes cannot escape.
    ///
    /// So the two mechanisms divide the space rather than compete: this
    /// guard keeps sync tests serialised, and `scoped` isolates async ones.
    /// A NEW async test needs `scoped::enter`, and nothing here can make it
    /// -- which is why the mechanism is the fix and this comment is the
    /// pointer to it.
    ///
    /// One hop, not a full closure, and the limit is stated because it is
    /// real: the hop is resolved inside the test's OWN file via
    /// [`fn_bodies`], so a test calling a helper in a sibling module that

    /// - **Whether the lock is held for long ENOUGH.** A test taking the
    ///   guard and dropping it immediately passes. The `_g` binding idiom
    ///   (an underscore-prefixed name held to end of scope) is what the
    ///   existing tests use and what review should look for; this asserts
    ///   the lock is taken at all, which is the half that was missing six
    ///   times.
    /// - **`RestoreObserved`.** NOT asserted. The lock stops two tests
    ///   racing; the restore guard stops a seeded figure leaking into
    ///   whatever runs next, and the two were added together in #868. Only
    ///   the lock is required here, because the restore is conditional on
    ///   the test actually seeding a figure and "did this test seed one"
    ///   cannot be read off the text -- demanding it everywhere would
    ///   report the tests that only READ the static, and a guard that asks
    ///   for a line somebody then has to justify is how the ~40-false-
    ///   positive mistake starts. The lock is the half that was missing six
    ///   times.
    /// - **Async tests.** `#[tokio::test]` is skipped, and this is a limit
    ///   of the RULE, not of the scan: `observed_test_lock` hands back a
    ///   `std::sync::MutexGuard`, and clippy's `await_holding_lock` --
    ///   under the `-D warnings` that CI's `lint` job runs -- rejects
    ///   holding one across an `.await`. So an async test cannot comply.
    ///   `client.rs` has five that reach `note_remaining` through
    ///   `fetch_prs_with_total` and are latent races for that reason;
    ///   MEASURED, adding the lock to them fails the build with five

    /// listener for every other request.
    ///
    /// # What it replaces
    ///
    /// `commands::tests::docker_commands_never_block_the_async_runtime`,
    /// which asserted the same rule -- in the same words, *"a plain `fn`
    /// stalls the runtime and freezes the entire UI"* -- over an allowlist
    /// of FOUR hardcoded names. #1090's finding is that the siblings of
    /// those four were among the offenders: `docker_dangling_volumes` and
    /// `docker_running_containers` shell out and were both plain `fn`,
    /// one name away from a rule that already covered them in spirit.

    /// The proof that this was live rather than theoretical is an
    /// asymmetry: `remote/surface.rs` wrapped those two in `blocking()`
    /// for the phone, citing #496 as *"this bug in the webview"*, while
    /// the desktop called the same two functions synchronously. One path
    /// knew; the other did not; nothing checked.
    ///
    /// # Why subprocesses and whole-file reads, and NOT SQLite
    ///
    /// This is the part that decides whether the guard survives. A rule
    /// of "reaches the filesystem or SQLite" flags 18 commands here, 15
    /// of which are single-row settings reads -- `get_notify_prefs`,
    /// `get_ui_prefs`, `get_cleanup_prefs`, `get_poll_interval` and their
    /// setters. Those are one indexed lookup against a local database
    /// file, they are what the app does on every window focus, and a
    /// guard demanding `spawn_blocking` around each of them would be
    /// weakened or deleted within a week -- which is the outcome
    /// `check-privacy.sh:120` records ~40 false positives buying.
    ///
    /// So the trigger is the UNBOUNDED work, which is what actually
    /// froze the UI in every incident this rule has a number for:
    ///
    /// - **a subprocess**, because its cost is another program's. #496
    ///   was five seconds of `docker`; `assessed_worktrees` was `git
    ///   rev-parse HEAD` once per worktree over ~295 of them, on a
    ///   five-second refresh cadence.
    /// - **a whole-file read**, because nothing bounds the file.
    ///   `read_claude_md` was `read_to_string` of an arbitrary path,
    ///   dispatched inline on the remote surface.
    ///
    /// `std::fs::metadata` is deliberately NOT in the list.
    /// `claude_reveal_path` stats one path to tell "deleted" from "cannot
    /// tell", which is a single syscall, and flagging it would be the
    /// false positive that costs this guard its credibility for no defect
    /// caught.
    ///
    /// # What it cannot see
    ///
    /// **One hop.** The scan reads the command's OWN body and does not
    /// follow calls. That is a measured choice, not laziness: following
    /// bare names one level -- the technique `fn_bodies` uses for
    /// invariant 7, whose doc already warns it "is not a call graph" --
    /// reports `list_paired_devices` as an offender, because its
    /// `devices::list(&conn)` (a SQL query) matches some other `list` in
    /// the tree that reads a file. Six flags, of which two were real and
    /// four were name collisions. A guard that is right one time in three
    /// does not survive contact with anyone in a hurry, so this checks
    /// what it can check exactly.
    ///
    /// The cost is real and worth stating: a command that moves its
    /// `Command::new` into a private helper passes this. What catches
    /// that is the same thing that caught these -- somebody noticing the
    /// UI freeze -- and the guard at least ensures the direct spelling,
    /// which is what every offender in #1090 actually used, cannot come
    /// back.
    ///
    /// **A command in another crate.** `src-mobile` and the stepup crate
    /// register no `#[tauri::command]`, so walking all three roots costs
    /// nothing and covers them the moment one does.
    ///
    /// # Proven by sabotage, both directions
    ///
    /// **It fires on the real defect.** Reverting `read_claude_md` to a
    /// `pub fn` with its bare `read_to_string` -- the shape it shipped in
    /// -- fails here naming the file, the command and the pattern. Adding
    /// a brand-new `pub fn` command that runs `std::process::Command`
    /// fails the same way, which is the case the four-name allowlist
    /// could not see at all.
    ///
    /// **It stays silent on the trivial one.** With the tree as it
    /// stands, all 15 single-row settings commands -- `get_notify_prefs`,
    /// `get_ui_prefs`, `get_cleanup_prefs`, `get_poll_interval`,
    /// `get_worktree_dirs`, `get_cached`, `get_cached_reviewing`,
    /// `cleanup_log`, five setters, `mark_assessed` and `clear_assessed`
    /// -- pass, and that was checked rather than assumed.
    ///
    /// The two halves were then checked against each other, one command
    /// at a time: giving each of those 15 a real `read_to_string` in its
    /// body makes this fail naming that command, all 15 of 15. So the
    /// silence is about what they DO and not about which file they live
    /// in or what they are called -- which is the failure mode the guard
    /// skill records as "passing for the wrong reason".
    ///
    /// **And it was proven on a CRLF checkout**, which sabotage alone does
    /// not cover: sabotaging a guard shows it reacts to the defect and
    /// says nothing about the platform it runs on. `every_installed_hook_
    /// event_has_a_measured_worst_case_record` records this repository
    /// shipping exactly that -- every sabotage passing, the negative
    /// direction silent, green on macOS, and `platform (windows-latest)`
    /// failing because a CRLF checkout made every `\n` a `\r\n`.
    ///
    /// So it was reproduced rather than assumed: converting `commands.rs`
    /// to CRLF and injecting a sync `Command::new` command fails here
    /// naming it, with no new false positive. The `replace("\r\n", "\n")`
    /// below is what makes that true, and it is tested.
    /// A platform `cfg` block must not `return` with a sibling below it.

    /// ```ignore

    /// `clippy::needless_return` fires, `-D warnings` rejects it, and
    /// the build fails.
    ///
    /// #1219 shipped exactly that and paid a CI round-trip for it. The

    ///
    /// ```text
