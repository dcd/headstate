//! Browsing a repository's files, the way GitHub's code view does
//! (#1031, #1032, #1033, epic #1011).
//!
//! Two questions, each answered by one bounded function: what is in this
//! directory, and what is in this file. Both take a repository root and a
//! repository-relative path, and both refuse a path that is not inside
//! that root.
//!
//! # Why the listing comes from the git index and not from `readdir`
//!
//! Measured in this repository's own checkout: **672 tracked files
//! against 623,488 on disk in the developer's main checkout -- 928x**.
//! Across that machine's whole scan root it is 30,349 tracked files
//! against roughly a million. Every one of the fifteen largest
//! directories under it is a build artifact directory git already
//! ignores; the biggest is `src-tauri/target/debug/deps` at 33,574
//! entries.
//!
//! The cost differs by the same order:
//!
//! ```text
//! git ls-files, whole repo                 0.01s
//! git ls-files -- <subdir>                 0.014s
//! scandir + stat over target/debug/deps    0.718s
//! ```
//!
//! So a filesystem walk would show the user 623,478 entries in Headstate's
//! own repository, of which 672 are the repository. That is not a code
//! view, it is a build directory -- and re-implementing `.gitignore` to
//! filter it back down is re-deriving what the index already answers, at
//! fifty times the cost, on a rule that would get `node_modules` right and
//! `target/debug/deps` wrong on some repository eventually. Git is
//! already the authority for "what is in this repository" and it answers
//! in 10ms.
//!
//! # And a second, independent argument: the index is a narrower surface
//!
//! The performance case above is not the only one, and the other half is
//! about safety. Measured under the same scan root: **21 symlinks escape
//! their repository root, and every one of them is untracked** --
//! `.venv/bin/python*` shims pointing into `~/.pyenv` and
//! `~/.local/share/uv`. Because they live in `.venv/`, `git ls-files`
//! cannot see them, so under index-based listing they are never
//! enumerated and **never reach [`repo_path_in`] at all**.
//!
//! A filesystem walk would hand that guard 21 separate chances to be
//! wrong about a path resolving into `~/.pyenv`. Listing from the index
//! means the guard's symlink refusal is defence in depth rather than the
//! sole barrier -- and the tracked population it does face is 22 links
//! across 38 repositories, 0 of which escape.
//!
//! So a future change that wants the filesystem walk after all (to show
//! untracked files, say) does not merely owe an answer about 623,478
//! entries. It also moves the containment guard from second line of
//! defence to first, against a population three times the size and
//! measurably hostile.
//!
//! One directory LEVEL per call, not the whole tree. 30,349 files is
//! small in total, but the code view descends one level at a time and the
//! response should be the level being shown -- and `git ls-files --
//! <subdir>` is measured at the same 14ms as the whole-repo listing, so
//! there is nothing to win by fetching more.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero
//!
//! `caches/mod.rs:550` states the rule and #846 is where it was shipped
//! wrong. There are three outcomes here, not two:
//!
//! - git succeeded and the directory holds no tracked files -> an empty
//!   [`Tree`]. A real answer, and at a path the tree itself produced it is
//!   the "it vanished" signal.
//! - git failed -- not a repository, a permission wall, git missing from a
//!   GUI-launched app's PATH -> an `Err` carrying git's own message. It
//!   must never become an empty listing.
//! - the path was refused by the guard -> an `Err` naming which test
//!   failed, because the four remedies differ.
//!
//! `PartialScanNotice`'s comment names exactly those causes and says why a
//! message beats a boolean: they send the user to three different places,
//! and only the message distinguishes them.

///    links and leaves nothing to detect". A symlink is refused outright
///    rather than followed -- see [`Entry::symlink`] for the measurement

///    measured reason `transcript_path_in` records: on macOS `/Users/...`
///    resolves through `/System/Volumes/Data`, so comparing a resolved

///    not under the root.

/// # Errors
