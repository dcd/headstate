//! The URL of the running build's release notes (#1239).
//!
//! # Why this is not one `format!` at the call site
//!
//! `latest_release` can tell the user a newer version exists and
//! cannot tell them what changed -- they get a version number and go
//! looking for the rest themselves. Closing that is a small feature
//! with three distinct ways to be confidently wrong, and each one is
//! easy to write by accident:
//!
//! **The version must be the RUNTIME one.** `latest_release`'s own
//! comment records why: the release workflow stamps the tag into the
//! manifests at build time and never commits them, so the compiled-in
//! `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` reads `0.1.0` in a dev build. A menu item
//! pointing at `v0.1.0`'s notes would be wrong on every developer
//! machine and right in CI, which is the worst way for a bug to
//! behave.
//!
//! **An unreleased build has no notes, and that is not an error.** A
//! dev build's version does not name a published tag. Pointing it at
//! the releases INDEX is the honest answer -- there is a real page
//! listing what exists -- where a tag URL would 404 and read as
//! something broken.
//!
//! So the two cases are [`Target::Tag`] and [`Target::Index`], and
//! they are separate variants rather than one string, because the menu
//! label differs: "Release notes for v6.0.1" is a promise about a
//! specific page and "All releases" is not.
//!
//! Fetching the BODY of the notes is deliberately not done here. That
//! would add the failure mode the issue warns about -- a request that
//! fails must read as "could not reach GitHub", never as "this release
//! shipped without notes" -- and opening a URL has no such mode: the
//! browser reports its own failure in its own words.
