//! Base-branch review gates: can the viewer's approval count, and must
//! conversations be resolved before merge (#1451, #1454).
//!
//! Some repositories' rules require the most recent push to be approved by
//! someone other than its pusher (`require_last_push_approval`), or every
//! review thread to be resolved before merge
//! (`required_review_thread_resolution`). Headstate fetched neither, so it
//! offered Approve to the one person whose approval could not count, and
//! reported "a required review or check is missing" for a merge that was
//! waiting on conversations.
//!
//! # What the API actually answers (MEASURED 2026-09-25, live `gh api`)
//!
//! - `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/rules/branches/{branch}` is readable WITHOUT admin:
//!   a public repository the measuring account has only `pull` on returned
//!   its `pull_request` rule with `parameters.require_last_push_approval:
//!   true`. `X-RateLimit-Resource: core`.
//! - It returns RULESET rules only. Classic branch protection is invisible
//!   to it, and reading that (`/branches/{b}/protection`) answered 404 to
//!   the same non-admin account. So an EMPTY answer is "no ruleset asks",
//!   never "no rule" -- the UI draws no conclusion from `false`.
//! - One branch can carry SEVERAL `pull_request` rules (repository and
//!   organization rulesets stack; one measured branch had four). GitHub
//!   enforces all of them, so a requirement is on if ANY rule sets it.
//! - A slash in the branch name works unencoded (`rules/branches/release/x`).
//! - `GET /repos/{o}/{r}/activity?ref=refs/heads/{head}` names the pusher as
//!   `actor`. **`activity_type=push` is NOT enough**, contrary to the
//!   issue's sketch: a branch whose only push created it is recorded as
//!   `branch_creation`, and the filtered query returned an EMPTY list for
//!   such a head. So this reads the unfiltered list and takes the newest
//!   entry that moved the ref.
//! - A fork's head lives in the fork, and the activity API answered there.
//!
//! # What this refuses to claim
//!
//! - **Rules unreadable** (403/404, a network failure, a budget refusal):
//!   nothing new is rendered. "We could not ask" is not "no rule".
//! - **Pusher unknown**: the newest ref-moving activity must name the SAME
//!   commit the detail view shows. If it does not -- the activity log lags,
//!   the branch moved since the detail was fetched, the actor was deleted --
//!   the pusher is unknown. The head commit's author or committer is never
//!   used as a stand-in: it only approximates the pusher (a rebase, a
//!   cherry-pick, or pushing someone else's commits all break it), and the
//!   claim this feeds -- "your approval won't count" -- disables a button.
