//! The remote allowlist: the single place that decides what a paired
//! phone can do.
//!
//! Every Tauri command registered in `lib.rs`'s `generate_handler!` has
//! exactly one row in [`SURFACE`], and the row's [`Class`] is the whole
//! policy. A command added to `generate_handler!` without a row here
//! fails [`tests::every_registered_command_has_exactly_one_class`], so a
//! new command can be neither exposed nor omitted silently.
//!
//! # Contract for the `POST /v1/call/{command}` handler
//!
//! The HTTP route lives in `remote/listener.rs`, not here. The handler
//! that mounts it must:
//!
//! 1. Read `{command}` from the path and the JSON body as
//!    `serde_json::Value` (an object of camelCase keys, exactly what the
//!    webview passes to `invoke`; an empty or absent body is `{}`).
//! 2. Look the command up with [`class_of`]. When it is
//!    [`Class::Destructive`], verify the `X-Headstate-Signature` step-up
//!    header (nonce, timestamp, and every signature the pairing record
//!    expects) BEFORE calling [`dispatch`]. `dispatch` does not check
//!    signatures; it trusts that the caller already refused a destructive
//!    request without a valid one.
//! 3. Call [`dispatch`] with the paired device's name and map the result:
//!    `Ok(value)` is the response body, and each [`RemoteError`] variant
//!    documents the status it should become.
//!
//! `dispatch` refuses [`Class::Local`] and unknown commands itself, so a
//! handler that skips step 2 for a non-destructive command is still safe;
//! it is the signature check that only the handler can do.

    // same `worktrees::update`, inheriting its fresh per-repository dirty
    // check, its `--ff-only`, and every refusal in it. There is no code
    // path by which a phone can fast-forward a repository the desktop
    // would not. That is the property `stats_board`'s row relies on: the
    // limits live INSIDE the command, so exposure costs no second set to
    // keep in sync. Classing it `Local` would also class by WHICH SCREEN
    // calls it rather than by what it does, which `stats_tree`'s row
    // rejects explicitly.
    //
    // **Not `Destructive`.** This table draws that line at DELETION, and
    // says so four times -- unlock ("nothing is deleted"), `fetch_refs`
    // ("passes no `--prune`, precisely so that it cannot delete"),
    // `apply_updates_in_background` ("deleting nothing"). A `--ff-only`
    // pull deletes nothing: it creates no merge commit, discards no
    // commit, and on refusal leaves the working tree byte-identical.
    // Dirty trees are refused outright, so there is no uncommitted work
    // for it to touch. The closest precedent is
    // `apply_updates_in_background` below -- already a bulk,
    // long-running, cancellable working-tree mutation started from a

    // The counter-argument, stated because it deserves to be: Destructive
    // is the only class carrying a step-up signature, and a bulk action
    // across 45 repositories is where a mis-tap costs most. But step-up
    // is not a general "are you sure" -- it is this table's marker for
    // deletion, and stretching it to mean "large" would make the class
    // mean two things and leave the next author unable to tell which.
    // Confirmation for a bulk action belongs in the UI, where it can name
    // the count and say what will be skipped; step-up can say neither.
    //
    // Exposed only because it can be STOPPED and its outcome read back
    // after a suspension -- `cancel_update_all` and `update_all_state`
