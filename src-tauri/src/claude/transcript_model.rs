//! A transcript as stable, render-ready messages (#1475, epic #1473).
//!
//! `preview.rs` answers "what was this session doing" for the pane that
//! exists today. It keys nothing, renders two record types and counts
//! the rest away. That is right for a preview and wrong for a viewer: the
//! desktop terminal renderer, the phone bubbles, live follow, paging and
//! 7.10's sent-message echo all need one model with
//!
//! - an id per message that survives a re-read,
//! - the turn each message belongs to,
//! - every record kind a reader should see, and
//! - per-block truncation that says how much was kept.
//!
//! This module is that model. It is ADDITIVE: `preview.rs` keeps serving
//! the current pane unchanged, and shares its tool-argument and diff
//! parsers with this one ([`super::preview::tool_args`],
//! [`super::preview::file_change`]) so the two readings of a tool call
//! cannot drift.
//!
//! # Record shapes, measured
//!
//! Over 300 real transcripts (96,361 records) on the development
//! machine:
//!
//! ```text
//!  30908 attachment        6415 queue-operation     2999 mode
//!  21664 assistant         4122 atis-latch          2997 permission-mode
//!  12784 user              4115 last-prompt         2466 system
//!                          3923 ai-title             304 file-history-snapshot
//!                          3496 pr-link              110 cost-state
//! ```
//!
//! `system` subtypes: `turn_duration` 3625, `stop_hook_summary` 3605,
//! `away_summary` 1153, `compact_boundary` 45, `informational` 18,
//! `api_error` 10, `local_command` 8, `agents_killed` 1 (3,000 files).
//!
//! `attachment` is mostly machinery (`total_tokens_reminder`,
//! `skill_listing`, `environment`, ...) with two exceptions a reader
//! wants: hook output (`hook_success` 15,631, `hook_cancelled`,
//! `hook_system_message`, `hook_additional_context`) and queued prompts.
//!
//! `user` records are not all "You". Measured over the non-tool-result
//! ones: 2,515 are `<task-notification>` (a background agent reporting
//! back), 17 are `<command-name>` slash commands, 13 are local command
//! output, 18 are `!` shell input, 12 are interruptions, and 65 carry
//! `isMeta` (skill bodies, caveats, auto-continuations). Rendering those
//! as the user speaking is the defect the issue names.
//!
//! # An allowlist that grows, and an explicit remainder
//!
//! Still an allowlist, for `preview.rs`'s reason: Claude Code owns this
//! format and changes it. What changes is what happens to a record that
//! is on no list. `preview.rs` counts it and drops it; here it becomes a
//! [`MessageKind::Unrecognised`] message carrying its type, so a renderer
//! draws a thin "unrecognised record" divider where it sat. An exchange
//! with an invisible hole in it is the #846 defect.
//!
//! Records that ARE recognised as bookkeeping -- the `queue-operation`,
//! `ai-title` and `skill_listing` kind -- are counted by type in
//! [`TranscriptPage::machinery_records`] and not rendered. That list is
//! named in [`MACHINERY_TYPES`] and [`MACHINERY_ATTACHMENTS`]; a record
//! type nobody listed is unrecognised, never machinery by default.
//!
//! Run over the tail windows of 1,133 real transcripts before the lists
//! were final, this produced 10,690 messages of 16 kinds and two
//! unrecognised types -- `agent-setting` and
//! `attachment/read_truncation_notice`, both bookkeeping, both since
//! listed. That is the remainder working as designed: the first sight of
//! a new type was a divider naming it, not a silent gap.
//!
//! # Ids
//!
//! See [`IdSource`]. Every record type that carries conversation has a
//! `uuid` (measured: 100% of `user`, `assistant`, `system` and
//! `attachment` records), so the documented fallback only ever applies to
//! the uuid-less bookkeeping types -- of which `permission-mode` is the
//! one rendered.
//!
//! **Duplicate uuids exist.** 32 in 3,000 files: the same message written
//! twice, differing only in `cwd` / `gitBranch` / `slug` / `promptId`
//! (a resumed session re-recording its head). The FIRST occurrence wins
//! and later ones are counted in [`TranscriptPage::duplicate_records`],
//! so ids stay unique and a React key never collides.
//!
//! # Read-only
//!
//! Like `preview.rs`, this adds no write exception under `~/.claude`.

///    different window, and a compaction (a compaction writes NEW records;
///    it does not renumber old ones).
/// 2. **`Anchored`** -- a record with no `uuid` gets
///    `"<previous uuid>+<n>"`: the nearest preceding uuid-bearing record,
///    and its ordinal among the uuid-less records since. At the start of
///    the file the anchor is `^`. Stable for any read that includes the
///    anchor record, which every append-only follow and every page that
///    starts before it does.
/// 3. **`Unanchored`** -- a uuid-less record read before any uuid-bearing
///    one in a window that starts mid-file. There is no anchor to name,
///    so the id is `"~<hash of the line>"` (with `.2`, `.3` for identical
///    lines in the window). Stable across re-reads of the same bytes;
///    it can change if the window moves, and says so by being this
///    variant.
/// 4. **`Derived`** -- a message this module produced rather than read:
///    a [`MessageKind::ModelChange`] between two assistant messages,
///    keyed `"<assistant id>/model"`.
///
/// A record with neither a uuid nor a stable position is not given a

///   pages move, record ids do not.
/// - **Uuid ids only.** A fallback id ([`IdSource`]) names a position,
///   not a record, and the records that get one (`permission-mode`)
///   carry no clipped text anyway. Asking for one is refused by name.
/// - **The same parser** re-reads the record with [`FULL_TEXT_CHARS`] in
///   place of the per-block cap, so block `index` of the fetch is by
///   construction the block that was clipped.
/// - **Bounded server-side**: the response is at most [`FULL_TEXT_CHARS`]
///   characters and says when that bound bit.
/// - **Found by offset when the caller knows it** (#1220). Every message
///   and tool output carries its record's `offset`; handed back as
///   `hint`, the fetch reads that ONE record -- streamed through
///   `transcript_skim`, so even a 10 MB record costs one read buffer
///   plus the characters returned -- and checks its uuid. #1475 measured
///   the scan below as a full read per fetch on a large file.
/// - **Otherwise, or when the hint misses, a scan.** A hint misses when
///   the file was rewritten under it; the scan is the answer that still
///   works. It reads line by line, parsing only lines that contain the
///   id; the FIRST record with that uuid wins, matching [`parse`]'s
///   duplicate rule. (A hint names one record, which may be a later
///   duplicate; duplicates differ only in `cwd`, `gitBranch`, `slug` and
///   `promptId`, never in text -- see the module docs.)
