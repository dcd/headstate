//! Silently-broken agent configuration, swept across every repository
//! (#1217).
//!
//! `install.rs`'s header records the measurement this module exists for.
//! `claude` was started with a deliberately corrupt `settings.json`: it
//! "started normally, answered normally, and the hooks **never ran**. No
//! error, no warning, no line on stderr."
//!
//! Headstate already detected exactly one instance of that class, for
//! one file, as a side effect of asking a different question -- the
//! install dialog reads `~/.claude/settings.json` before it writes to
//! it. Across ~38 checkouts nothing asked at all. A repository whose
//! `.claude/settings.local.json` lost a brace has every rule in that
//! file inert, forever, with no symptom anyone would connect to it.
//!
//! # Findings are CHECKS, never opinions
//!
//! The load-bearing rule, and the reason this module is small. Every
//! [`Finding`] carries a [`Finding::proof`] that is a sentence the
//! producing code already wrote: serde's own parse error with its line
//! and column, or an import resolver's own message. Nothing here
//! inspects a config and forms a view about it.
//!
//! That is not squeamishness. A health page that mixes "this file
//! failed to parse at line 4 column 12" with "this config looks
//! unusual" trains its reader to skim both, and an ignored health page
//! is worse than no health page because it looks like coverage. So
//! there is no heuristic here, no style judgement, and no threshold:
//! the only things reported are a parser that refused and a resolver
//! that could not resolve.
//!
//! [`ScopeRefusal::detail`] already satisfies this, which is why
//! [`settings::effective_in`] is CALLED rather than reimplemented. A
//! second settings parser in this tree would be a second source of
//! truth about someone else's file format, and wrong the moment the
//! first one changed.
//!
//! # A check that could not run is not a check that passed
//!
//! #1042's rule, arriving here for the third time. A repository whose
//! `.claude/` directory could not be listed has an unknown number of
//! problems in it, not zero. It reports [`Verdict::Unknown`], and
//! [`Verdict::rank`] orders Unknown AWAY from the passes rather than
//! beside them -- sorting a repository we could not look at next to
//! thirty we cleared is how "we did not check" becomes "it is fine".
//!
//! # The finding names the SCOPE
//!
//! A repository where only the local scope failed is not "unhealthy".
//! The remedy is one specific file, and naming it is the difference
//! between a page that fixes something and a red dot.
//!
//! So a finding carries the [`Origin`] whose file refused AND the
//! tracked keys that became [`ResolvedKey::undecidable`] because of it
//! -- which is the consequence the user actually feels. `settings.rs`
//! was built to preserve that per-scope distinction; flattening three
//! scopes into one indicator here would discard it one layer up.
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT checked
//!
//! No PATH check for a hook binary, no MCP stdio command check, no
//! cross-scope shadowing. Those need #1215 and #1216 and are not
//! half-built the way parse failures and import problems already are.
//! Shipping a guess at them would violate the first rule above on the
//! first screen.
//!
//! # What it costs, measured
//!
//! Over this machine's real `~/code`: **39 repositories, 2.0 s to find
//! them and 5.6 s to sweep them cold**, 0.9 s warm once the OS page
//! cache is hot.
//!
//! The two halves were timed apart rather than guessed at, because they
//! are not remotely comparable:
//!
//! ```text
//! settings check (3 file reads x 39 repos)     10 ms
//! CLAUDE.md walk (directory tree x 39 repos)  4737 ms
//! ```
//!
//! So the settings half -- the one this ticket is actually about -- is
//! free, and essentially all the cost was `claudemd::scan_repo` walking
//! directory trees. It is NOT quadratic: nothing compares repositories
//! to each other, so the cost is linear in repositories and in the
//! directories each walk visits.
//!
//! # What #1236 changed, and what it did not
//!
//! That walk was 99.8% of the sweep, so it was attacked at the source:
//! `claudemd`'s `SKIP` list did not name `.venv`, `Pods`,
//! `__pycache__` or the JS toolchain caches, and the walk was listing
//! **22,265 directories to find 42 files**. Naming them cut it to
//! 9,682 directories -- **5.9x faster, and all 42 files still found**.
//!
//! The per-repository distribution is what made that the right fix.
//! The cost was extremely skewed -- five repositories were 76% of it --
//! so this was a traversal problem in a handful of trees rather than a
//! caching problem across 39. Caching would have made a second sweep
//! cheap while leaving the first one slow; this makes every sweep
//! cheap.
//!
//! Nothing here was made narrower, and that is deliberate. A
//! depth-limited walk was measured first and REJECTED: no depth reached
//! full coverage, so every workable bound turned most repositories into
//! [`Verdict::Unknown`] and bought its speed by lowering what the sweep
//! claims to have checked. Skipping a directory that provably holds no
//! instructions costs no coverage, so every verdict this module
//! produces is unchanged -- measured, 39 clean before and 39 clean
//! after. The command is still `async`, the panel is still collapsed by
//! default, and its query still does not refetch on window focus.
//!
//! Read-only. Nothing here writes, repairs, or offers to.
