//! Installed plugins, and what they were actually used for (#1075).
//!
//! Two halves that answer two different questions. The inventory --
//! `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` -- says what is installed.
//! The usage scan says what was CALLED. The page exists because those
//! two lists are very different: 22 plugins installed on the development
//! machine, 7 of which show any usage at all.
//!
//! # The defect this module exists to avoid
//!
//! A plugin's tool names appear in **every session's availability list**
//! -- the set of tools the model may call -- not only when one is
//! called. So a grep for the name counts the wrong thing, by three
//! orders of magnitude.
//!
//! MEASURED over the whole corpus (2,474 transcripts, 1.7 GB), counting
//! every mention of a plugin tool name against counting only `tool_use`:
//!
//! | Plugin | Mentions | Actual calls |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `chrome-devtools-mcp` | 69,765 | **0** |
//! | `playwright` | 57,602 | 44 |
//! | `deploy-on-aws` | 55,335 | 32 |
//! | `context7` | 4,838 | 8 |
//! | `huggingface-skills` | 4,786 | **0** |
//!
//! The naive count does not merely inflate the numbers, it INVERTS the
//! ranking: it reports `chrome-devtools-mcp` as by far the busiest
//! plugin on the machine, and it has never been called once. A page
//! built that way would tell the user their unused plugins are their
//! most valuable ones -- the exact inverse of the question being asked,
//! rendered as a confident chart.
//!
//! **Only a record whose `"type"` is `"tool_use"` is an invocation.**
//! That single test is what [`count_line`] is for, and
//! `an_availability_list_contributes_no_calls` is the test that holds it.
//!
//! ## Where the availability names actually live, and what excludes them
//!
//! Worth stating precisely, because it decides what the counting code
//! must do and a sabotage proof got this wrong once.
//!
//! The 69,765 mentions are NOT `message.content` blocks. They arrive as
//! `attachment` records of type `deferred_tools_delta` carrying an
//! `addedNames` array, plus the `rendered` system-reminder that lists
//! the same names as prose. Neither is under `message.content` at all.
//!
//! MEASURED over the whole corpus: of every block inside
//! `message.content` that carries a `name` field beginning
//! `mcp__plugin_`, **85 are `tool_use` and 0 are anything else.** So on
//! today's transcript format the excluding work is done by the
//! STRUCTURAL path -- only looking at `message.content` blocks, and only
//! at their `name` -- and the `type == "tool_use"` check is a defensive
//! belt that no current record exercises.
//!
//! Both are kept. The structural path is what a naive implementation
//! gets wrong (a `grep`, or a scan of the whole record, counts the
//! attachments and inverts the ranking), and the type check is what a
//! future format change would need if a non-call block ever gained a
//! `name`. The test drives the first, because that is the one carrying
//! weight today; a sabotage of the type check alone does NOT fail it,
//! and pretending otherwise would claim a proof this module does not
//! have.
//!
//! # Attribution: four contributions, four traces
//!
//! | Contribution | Trace |
//! |---|---|
//! | MCP server | tool named `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>` |
//! | Skill | `Skill` tool, `skill: "<plugin>:<name>"` |
//! | Agent | `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "<plugin>:<name>"` |
//! | Command | `<command-name>/name</command-name>` |
//!
//! A skill or agent with **no** colon prefix is built-in -- `Skill` with
//! `skill: "commit"` is Claude Code's own -- and attributing it to a
//! plugin would credit a plugin for work it did not do. [`plugin_of`]
//! returns `None` for those, deliberately.
//!
//! # Why an incremental store, and not a scan per page load
//!
//! MEASURED: a full-body pass over the corpus is 7-18 seconds. That is
//! affordable ONCE and never on a page load. [`super::transcript`]
//! deliberately reads only 40 head records and a 16 KB tail precisely so
//! that nothing on a normal path touches the corpus body, and this
//! module does not widen that reader -- it is a separate full-body pass
//! whose results are persisted per session, re-reading only transcripts
//! whose mtime moved. Migration 16 holds the table.
//!
//! # Every install is listed; only some apply to a repository
//!
//! [`parse_inventory`] keeps every entry, which is what this page shows.
//! The CLAUDE.md advice asks a narrower question -- what Claude Code
//! loads in ONE repository -- and [`for_repository`] answers it from the
//! same rows (#1364). That filter is never applied to this page.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero, and here it is the whole point
//!
//! This page is an argument about value: its output is the input to
//! "should I uninstall this?". A plugin we have no record for may have
//! never been used, or may simply predate the scan -- and a false zero
//! argues for uninstalling something the user relies on. So
//! [`PluginUsage::measured`] carries which of the two it is, and the UI
//! renders them differently.
//!
//! Nor is a true zero a verdict. `clangd-lsp`'s install path contains
//! exactly `LICENSE` and `README.md` -- no MCP server, no skills, no
//! agents, no commands. It contributes background behaviour that leaves
//! no tool call by construction, so counting its calls at zero measures
//! nothing about it. [`Contribution`] records what a plugin could
//! possibly contribute, so the page can say "nothing here is counted"
//! rather than "unused".

/// `managed` applies everywhere; otherwise it applies when `projectPath`
/// is the working directory, or when both resolve to the same
/// repository; and an entry with no `projectPath` applies nowhere.
///
/// Here "the same repository" is [`checkout_identity`]: the main
/// checkout's root, so a linked worktree of `repo` matches, and so does
/// `repo`'s main checkout when `repo` is itself a worktree.
///
/// - A `project` or `local` entry with no `projectPath` is left out. Not
///   "applies everywhere": Claude Code does not load it anywhere.
/// - A recorded path that no longer exists is left out. It is not this
///   repository, because this one exists.
/// - A recorded path that exists and could not be read, or a `repo` that
///   could not be, is UNDECIDED: returned with why, never applied. The
///   caller reports it, so the advice says what it could not check
