//! What the Claude Code view renders: one row per session (#917), the
//! resume command that actually works (#918), and whether each of the
//! two paths a session records is still on disk (#919).
//!
//! Reads `claude_session` and `claude_run` (migration 11), pairs each row
//! with a liveness derived from the machine ([`super::liveness`]), and
//! answers the one question the resume action turns on: does the
//! directory this session ran in still exist?
//!
//! # Two paths, two survival rates, two fields
//!
//! A session records a `cwd` AND a `transcript_path`, and they are not
//! interchangeable. Measured over 1,461 real session transcripts for
//! #919: **83.0% of cwds are gone (1,213) and 0% of transcripts are.**
//! So the cwd's state travels as [`ListRow::cwd_state`] and the
//! transcript's as [`SessionDetail::transcript_state`], as independent
//! tri-states, and neither is derived from the other. See
//! [`check_transcript`].
//!
//! # Why the cwd check is a tri-state and not a bool
//!
//! `claude --resume <id>` works from ANY directory -- verified -- and
//! adopts the **invoking** directory rather than the one the session
//! recorded. Measured on the development machine: **1,213 of 1,438
//! sessions (84.4%) have a cwd that no longer exists.**
//!
//! So a bare `claude --resume <id>` on the clipboard resurrects the
//! session pointed at whatever tree the user happens to be standing in
//! -- worse than failing, because it looks like it worked. The session
//! arrives with all its context and intentions and starts editing the
//! wrong repository.
//!
//! Three cases, and the third is not padding:
//!
//! | recorded cwd | what [`ResumeCommand`] offers |
//! |---|---|
//! | exists | `cd <cwd> && claude --resume <id>` |
//! | gone | the bare command, and says the directory is gone |
//! | could not check | the bare command, and says we could not check |
//!
//! A permission error reading the path is a different answer from "the
//! directory is gone": one means the tree may well be there and the `cd`
//! would have worked, the other means it certainly is not. Collapsing
//! them is the absent-is-not-zero mistake, and the remedies differ --
//! one is "fix the permission", the other is "expect to land somewhere
//! else".
//!
//! # `session_id` is the handle, and it never goes stale
//!
//! Verified: the id survives `--resume` and `--continue` unchanged, only
//! a fresh start mints a new one, resuming does not consume it, and it
//! still resolves after the recorded cwd has been deleted -- the
//! transcript is keyed by the id, not by the path. So the handle in a
//! copied command is good indefinitely, which is what makes copying
//! text the right action rather than a link to something that expires.
//!
//! # No terminal is GUESSED, deliberately
//!
//! `commands::claudify_command` already settled this for the app:
//! copying text works identically everywhere and lands the user in their
//! OWN shell, while macOS has no default-terminal concept at all. This
//! module returns strings for the clipboard for the same reason.
//!
//! Since #1126 a user may configure one, and
//! `commands::claude_launch_session` opens it on the string this module
//! builds. Nothing here changed: it still returns text, caveats and all,
//! and with no terminal configured the clipboard remains the only
//! route. Spawning is `claude::launch`'s job, and it runs only what the
//! user configured.

/// # What was rejected, and why

/// - **A server-side `LIMIT`.** The obvious fix and the wrong one. Search
///   is this list's primary navigation by explicit design, and it filters
///   over the whole corpus on four fields; a limit silently turns it into
///   "search the most recent 200" -- a worse feature that still looks like
///   it works. It also makes the stated total a separate claim that can
///   drift from the rows beside it. Splitting by field gives a bigger
///   win with neither problem.
/// - **Moving search into SQL.** Preserves the corpus but not the
///   feature: the filtering is per-keystroke and a round-trip cannot be.
/// - **An `updated_since` cursor.** Liveness is derived per read and
///   changes with NO write to the row -- a session dies without touching
///   `last_activity_at` -- so rows outside the window would keep claiming
///   "running" until they happened to be written. That is precisely the
///   staleness migration 11's missing `status` column exists to prevent.
/// - **Lengthening the poll.** Does not reduce the payload, and the poll
///   is the only thing that makes a session stop saying "running".
