//! The restart list: every running session's resume command, as text
//! the user saves before a reboot (#1071).
//!
//! # The question this answers, and why it is not the overview's
//!
//! "I am about to restart this machine. Give me the lines I need to
//! bring everything back." That is a different question from the
//! overview page's, and the difference is the whole design:
//!
//! | page | selects | error that matters |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | overview's resumable list | NOT running, cwd exists | offering to resume something alive |
//! | this export | running (and might-be-running) | omitting work the user then loses |
//!
//! The overview is about what is already stopped. This is about what is
//! about to be stopped, by the user, deliberately -- and the two want
//! opposite treatment of an uncertain row.
//!
//! # Inclusive on uncertainty, and it says so
//!
//! [`super::liveness::Liveness`] has three states and `Unknown` is
//! explicitly NOT a shade of `Dead`. #984 is what happens when that is
//! forgotten: one registry read failed, `derive` returned `Unknown` for
//! everything, and the overview's `resumable` predicate -- "absent from
//! the running set" -- misclassified **183 of 1,491** sessions.
//!
//! In export form that defect is not a wrong tile, it is lost work. So
//! the two error directions are weighed rather than treated as equal:
//!
//! - A session **wrongly omitted** is work the user rebooted away. They
//!   saved the list and trusted it; there is no second chance to notice.
//! - A session **wrongly included** is one pasted line that resumes
//!   something already finished. Visible the moment it runs, and
//!   undone by closing the window.
//!
//! So `Unknown` is INCLUDED -- in its own clearly-labelled section, never
//! silently mixed in with the running ones, because "we could not tell"
//! is a different claim from "this is running" and a reader deciding what
//! to paste needs to see which is which.
//!
//! `Dead` is excluded. That is the one verdict the app actually reached,
//! and a restart list padded with 1,213 archived sessions is not a
//! restart list.
//!
//! # The export QUALIFIES itself, per the house rule
//!
//! Only-low -> qualify; possibly-wrong -> suppress. Both shortfalls here
//! are only-low, so both are qualified rather than suppressed:
//!
//! - `registry_failure` means the live registry could not be listed at
//!   all, so nothing could be positively established as running. Every
//!   row becomes `Unknown` and the header says the list may be short.
//! - `registry_unreadable` means individual records were present and
//!   unusable. Each one hides a session that may be running, so the
//!   count is a floor.
//!
//! Neither suppresses the export. A short list the user is TOLD is short
//! is worth more than no list at all before a reboot -- and the rows it
//! does carry were each positively established.
//!
//! # The commands are not built here
//!
//! [`super::sessions::resume_command`] builds them, and reusing it is not
//! a convenience -- it is the only way this export inherits the hardening
//! that function carries. Both halves of the line are shell-quoted (the
//! id is `path.file_stem()` of an arbitrary `*.jsonl`, not a validated
//! UUID, so a file named `` `id`.jsonl `` would otherwise put live shell
//! syntax in a list the user pastes blind), and there are FOUR cwd cases
//! rather than two, each with its own wording. A second implementation
//! here would reproduce the bug a review already caught once.
//!
//! # No terminal is spawned, and no file is written
//!
//! The user asked for text to paste, and that is what this returns.
//! Spawning terminals is a different feature with a much worse failure
//! mode -- macOS has no default-terminal concept, and `x-terminal-emulator`
//! is Debian-only, which is the same argument `sessions.rs` makes for
//! returning strings rather than launching anything. Writing to a path
//! the app picked would leave the restart list somewhere the user did not
//! choose and might never find; the frontend offers the text to copy or
//! to save wherever they want.
