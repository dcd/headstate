//! Full-text search over the transcript corpus (#1203, epic #1121).
//!
//! Headstate has always read the transcripts and indexed only their
//! METADATA -- session ids, working directories, timestamps, token
//! counts, pull-request links, crash rows. It indexed no content, so
//! "find the session where I was debugging the FSEvents thing" was a
//! question the app held the data for and could not answer.
//!
//! This module is the content index: SQLite FTS5, populated
//! incrementally by the live pass that already walks the corpus.
//!
//! # The corpus, and what indexing it costs
//!
//! Measured by `tests::real_corpus` against the real tree, release
//! build:
//!
//! ```text
//! sessions this app indexes   1,489 files   0.83 GB
//! subagent transcripts, excluded  1,037 files
//!
//! index build, cold, to full coverage    9,953 ms over 15 passes
//! steady-state index step                    3 ms
//! ADDED COST to the live pass, warm         56 ms (51 listing + 5 index)
//! database growth                         0.06 GB
//! transcripts truncated at 8 MB                17
//! query latency                           1-19 ms
//! ```
//!
//! # What the live pass pays, and what it used to (#1246)
//!
//! As #1203 shipped it, the added cost was **885 ms per tick**, and
//! only 5 ms of that was indexing. The other 880 ms was
//! `transcript::scan`, which `claude_live_pass` had no reason to call
//! before #1203 -- that is new work on that loop, and it was 99% of
//! the bill.
//!
//! #1246 removed it. The scan was never the work this module needed:
//! [`index_pass`] reads a session's `path` and `session_id` and the
//! scan's `unreadable_files`, and takes its own `fs::metadata` per file
//! because the ledger is keyed on `(size, mtime)`. `scan` opens every
//! transcript for a head read and a tail seek to recover a title, a cwd
//! and a last-activity time, then hands the file list to
//! `subagent::build`, which reads all 0.84 GB end to end. Every one of
//! those fields is discarded at the `index_pass` call.
//!
//! So the pass now calls [`super::transcript::corpus`], which walks the
//! tree and checks each transcript can be opened, but reads none of
//! them. Same 1,510 sessions, same denominator, same unreadable set --
//! **51 ms instead of 880**.
//!
//! ```text
//! added cost to the live pass, warm    #1203      #1246
//!   corpus listing / scan              880 ms     51 ms
//!   index step                           5 ms      5 ms
//!                                      ------     -----
//!                                      885 ms     56 ms
//! ```
//!
//! Measured four consecutive times with both paths warm, release
//! build: `corpus` 49-60 ms against `scan` 878-935 ms, the same 1,510
//! sessions each time. A **16x** reduction on the live pass, and the
//! remaining 56 ms is 0.09% of the 60-second tick.
//!
//! The same substitution was made in `claude_search_transcripts` and
//! `claude_index_coverage`, which each paid the same 880 ms for the
//! denominator alone -- on the path of a user waiting for a search
//! result rather than on a background timer.
//!
//! #1246's own suggestion was to share one scan with the session
//! import. It does not fit: `claude_import_transcripts` is a separate
//! user-triggered Tauri command, not part of the live pass, so there is
//! no shared tick to fold into. The issue's second suggestion, cheap
//! change detection before the walk, was aimed at the wrong cost -- the
//! walk and its stats are 15 ms of the 51, and the 829 ms that went
//! away was file CONTENT the indexer never looked at.
//!
//! # The index still advances every tick
//!
//! This does not slow the index down, which is the thing that would
//! have put the honesty property at risk. [`SESSIONS_PER_PASS`] is
//! unchanged, a pass still runs every 60 seconds, and a cold corpus
//! still reaches full coverage in about fifteen passes -- faster in
//! wall-clock terms, because each pass now spends its time indexing
//! rather than reading files it will throw away.
//!
//! # Two figures that are better than the issue assumed
//!
//! Not luck; the reason is worth stating so it is not lost.
//!
//! **0.06 GB, not 0.83 GB.** #1203 expected "a second copy of 881 MB of
//! text in the database". It is 7% of that, because [`readable_text`]
//! indexes the human text -- user prompts and assistant messages -- and
//! not the raw JSONL. The uuids, key names, tool payloads and base64
//! blobs that make up most of a transcript's bytes are not things
//! anybody searches for, and indexing them would have cost twelve times
//! the space to make `"type"` match all 1,489 sessions.
//!
//! **3 ms in the steady state.** That is what the live pass actually
//! pays every 60 seconds once the index is warm, because the ledger's
//! `(size, mtime)` check skips an unchanged transcript without opening
//! it. The 9.9 s figure is the cold build, paid once, spread over
//! fifteen passes so no single one of them blocks anything.
//!
//! A naive `du` on `~/.claude/projects` reports 1.8 GB because it counts
//! the subagent transcripts [`super::transcript`] excludes on purpose --
//! they live at `<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`, carry no
//! session id of their own, and `claude --resume` cannot open them. This
//! module indexes exactly what [`super::transcript::scan`] returns, so
//! the exclusion is inherited rather than re-implemented, and
//! `subagent_transcripts_are_not_indexed` pins it.
//!
//! # THE RULE: an unfinished index may never say "no matches"
//!
//! This is the whole feature, and everything below is built around it.
//!
//! An empty result has two causes that look identical on screen:
//!
//! | what happened | what the user must read |
//! |---|---|
//! | the whole corpus is searchable and nothing matched | "No matches" |
//! | only part of it is searchable and that part had none | "No matches **in the 340 of 1,482 sessions indexed so far**" |
//!
//! Those are different sentences and the difference is the feature. 6.0
//! removed exactly this conflation from four other surfaces (#846,
//! #1042, #1044, #1152) -- "we have not looked yet" is not "there is
//! nothing there" -- and a search box is the place a user is least
//! likely to question an empty result. A search that has not finished
//! indexing and reports "no matches" is the most legible possible lie:
//! it is a confident, complete-sounding answer to a question nobody
//! asked the whole corpus.
//!
//! So the answer type is [`SearchAnswer`], whose [`SearchAnswer::verdict`]
//! is a THREE-way [`Verdict`] rather than a list that might be empty.
//! There is no way to get an empty result out of this module without
//! also getting the coverage that qualifies it: `Verdict::None` cannot
//! be constructed while `coverage.is_complete()` is false, because
//! [`answer`] is the only constructor and it branches on exactly that.
//!
//! Logging the shortfall and returning a bare empty list was considered
//! and is rejected: a partial result declares itself to the person
//! reading it, not to a log file nobody opens.
//!
//! # Coverage is counted, not estimated
//!
//! [`Coverage`] carries `indexed` and `total` as real counts:
//! `indexed` is `SELECT COUNT(*)` over the ledger table, `total` is the
//! number of session transcripts the last scan actually found. Neither
//! is a ratio, a percentage or a guess, because the sentence the UI has
//! to write contains the two numbers literally.
//!
//! `unreadable` is the third count and it is NOT folded into the other
//! two. A transcript that could not be read is a KNOWN GAP in coverage:
//! it is not indexed, so it does not count toward `indexed`, but it also
//! is not merely pending -- re-running the pass will not fix it. Saying
//! "1,480 of 1,482 indexed" while two files are permanently unreadable
//! would report a stuck index as a finished one.
//!
//! # Staleness: a fact about the INDEX, not about the session
//!
//! #1152 established a six-hour freshness window for scan caches. This
//! index needs its own answer because the user is actively producing the
//! content it covers: a session written since the last pass is genuinely
//! not yet searchable.
//!
//! The distinction the UI must be able to draw, and which
//! [`Coverage::pending`] exists for: that session is not missing from
//! your history and it is not empty -- **the index has not reached it
//! yet**. Framing it as a property of the session ("this session has no
//! content") would be a claim about the user's data that is false. It is
//! a claim about our bookkeeping, and it is true.
//!
//! # Why the ledger is keyed on (size, mtime) and not on content
//!
//! Re-indexing a transcript costs a whole-file read of a file that can
//! reach 76.7 MB. The ledger stores the size and modification time each
//! session was indexed AT, so an unchanged transcript is skipped without
//! being opened -- which is what makes the steady state cheap enough to
//! ride along on a 60-second pass.
//!
//! A transcript that GREW is re-indexed whole rather than appended to:
//! FTS5 has no partial-row update, and the alternative -- storing one
//! FTS row per record -- multiplies the row count by the message count
//! for a search whose unit of interest is the session.
