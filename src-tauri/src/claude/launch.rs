//! Opening the user's own terminal on a command this app already built.
//!
//! Every Claude action in Headstate ended at the clipboard: copy a
//! string, switch to a terminal, paste -- while the app already knew the
//! working directory, the session id and the binary path (#1126).
//!
//! # What the clipboard argument actually said
//!
//! `commands::claudify_command` and [`super::sessions`] both record why
//! nothing is spawned: macOS has no default-terminal concept (no
//! LaunchServices handler, so a machine with both Terminal.app and iTerm
//! gives no way to know which the user wants), and on Linux
//! `x-terminal-emulator` is Debian-only.
//!
//! That rules out GUESSING a terminal. It does not rule out asking the
//! user once which one they use, which is all this module does. With no
//! template configured there is no launch path at all and the clipboard
//! remains the only route -- so the old rationale still holds wherever
//! it was true, and this is not a replacement for it.
//!
//! # The template is config, not input
//!
//! [`Template`] is a string the user typed into settings holding a
//! `{command}` placeholder. Headstate substitutes the already-built
//! shell line into it and runs the result.
//!
//! This is deliberately NOT a sandbox. A user who can edit their own
//! settings can already run anything as themselves, so a template that
//! runs an arbitrary program is not an escalation -- it is the feature.
//! What matters is the property the clipboard path already guarantees
//! and this must not lose: **the line that ends up running is the line
//! the button said it would run**. `resume_command` shell-quotes the
//! path and the session id precisely so a directory named `$(whoami)`
//! cannot inject; substituting that quoted string into a template keeps
//! its quoting intact, and [`Template::render`] never re-quotes or
//! unescapes it.
//!
//! # Argv, not a shell
//!
//! The template is split into argv on unquoted whitespace and spawned
//! directly -- it is NOT passed to `sh -c`. The command string lands in
//! exactly one argv slot, whatever it contains, so no amount of shell
//! metacharacter in a session id or a path can become a second word.
//! Handing the whole thing to a shell would undo `resume_command`'s
//! quoting one level up and is the obvious way to reintroduce the bug
//! it was written to fix.

/// guarantee end to end -- for that path the frontend passes a repository
/// path and an index, never a command and never a prompt, so there is no
/// point at which TypeScript could compose a line the backend then runs.
///
/// That is the same rule `claude_launch_worktree` states for itself:

///
/// # The one path that accepts a PROMPT: a pull request's Claudify (#1455)
///
/// `commands::claudify_pr_command`, `claude_launch_pr` and
/// `claude_launch_pr_preview` take the prompt as text, composed by
/// `src/lib/agentPrompt.ts` from the pull request fetch -- which the
/// backend does not hold, so it cannot rebuild the prompt itself the way
/// it looks up a brief. That is a weaker guarantee than #1292's, and it
/// is bounded by these limits, each enforced in Rust:
///
/// - The prompt occupies ONE single-quoted argv slot of `claude`, built
///   here by `prompt_command`; it never becomes shell.
/// - The directory is not trusted: `commands::pr_checkout` re-validates
///   it against the LIVE worktree scan (scanned, `origin` identity equal
///   to the pull request's repository, not bare).
/// - The launch and its preview are `Class::Local`, so no remote caller
///   -- a paired phone included -- can launch; only the desktop webview
///   can. The phone-reachable `claudify_pr_command` returns a string and
///   runs nothing.
/// - An empty prompt, or one with a NUL byte, is refused.
/// - The whole argv is previewed in the terms dialog before it runs
///   (#1214).
///
/// # How a multi-line Markdown prompt reaches `claude`, verified
///
/// The open question in #1292 was whether it can at all: `claude
/// --resume <id>` is the only line this repository had ever built, and a
/// brief is multi-line Markdown thick with backticks, `$(...)` and
/// apostrophes quoted out of the user's own files.
///
/// It can, and nothing has to be mangled to make it fit. `claude`'s
/// usage line is `claude [options] [command] [prompt]` -- the prompt is
/// a POSITIONAL ARGUMENT, so it is one argv slot and newlines in it are
/// just bytes. There is no length limit short enough to matter and no
/// escaping for Markdown to trip over.
///
/// Three layers each have to keep it in one piece, and each does:
///
/// 1. [`super::sessions::shell_quote`] wraps the brief in single quotes,
///    where every character except `'` is literal. A brief containing
///    `$(whoami)` is text, not a substitution -- the same property
///    `resume_command` relies on for the session id.
/// 2. The shell the template names (`bash -lc`, and the `-e`/`--` forms)
///    parses that quoted word back into exactly one argument, newlines
///    included.
/// 3. [`Template::render`] puts the whole command string into ONE argv
///    slot and never re-splits it, which is the invariant this module's
///    header calls "the line that keeps `resume_command`'s quoting
///    intact".
///
/// So the prompt `claude` receives is byte-for-byte the brief the
/// clipboard would have carried. That is the bar: Copy and Run must hand
/// over the same text, or the button that runs it is lying about what it
/// runs.
///
/// # The `open -a` presets that could not run anything (#1302)
///
/// This paragraph used to say that `open -a Terminal {command}` does not
/// run a command at all -- `open -a` takes FILE PATHS, so it hands
/// Terminal.app a filename -- and that repairing it was not this
/// function's job. The same defect was in the `iTerm` preset, uncovered
/// by that note, and it is what #1302 was reported against: the user
/// pressed Run and saw nothing at all.
///
/// Both presets now drive the app with `osascript` instead, and
/// [`watch_briefly`] makes an instant failure an error the user can
/// read rather than a silent success. Writing the defect down was not
/// enough to keep it from shipping twice, so the note has been replaced
