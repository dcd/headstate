//! The skills, subagents and slash commands on this machine (#1129).
//!
//! `plugins.rs` reports which plugins ship a `skills/`, `agents/` or
//! `commands/` directory and nothing about what is inside them:
//! `read_contribution` matches on directory NAMES and sets four
//! booleans. So a user could not answer "what subagents do I have, and
//! which have I ever used?" -- and every hand-written definition in
//! `~/.claude/` was invisible, because it belongs to no plugin at all.
//!
//! # Usage counts are NOT joined here, and the rule for adding them
//!
//! A `Definition` carries what is on disk and nothing about use: there
//! is no call count in this module, and an earlier version of this
//! header wrongly described one as already shipped (#1207).
//!
//! Stated as a requirement rather than a description, for whoever
//! joins the counts: `plugins.rs`'s "absent is not zero" argument
//! applies here unchanged. A definition with no recorded calls may
//! have never been used, or may simply predate the scan -- and a false
//! zero argues for deleting something the user relies on. So the field
//! must be `Option<u64>`, rendering `None` as "never observed" and
//! never as "0 calls". A plain `u64` reintroduces exactly the defect
//! `plugins.rs:89-105` exists to prevent.
//!
//! # What could not be read is reported
//!
//! A directory behind a permission wall hides an unknown number of
//! definitions. `claudemd::Scan` keeps its unreadable list for exactly
//! this reason, and the same rule holds here: an inventory that silently
//! omitted a subtree would say "you have three skills" about a machine
//! with thirty.
//!
//! # Three scopes, and no winner between them (#1215)
//!
//! `~/.claude` is one of several places a definition lives. A repository
//! carries its own `.claude/`, and every installed plugin ships its own
//! `skills/`, `agents/` and `commands/`. Scanning only the user's root
//! made ~38 repositories' worth of project definitions invisible, which
//! is the same shape as the absent-is-not-zero argument above: "you
//! have four skills" about a machine with forty.
//!
//! So [`scan_scopes`] calls [`scan_in`] once per root and stamps each
//! result with the [`Source`] it came from.
//!
//! ## Why a collision is SHOWN rather than resolved
//!
//! A project skill and a user skill with the same name are not two
//! independent entries -- one shadows the other, and which one wins is a
//! rule that belongs to Claude Code. `settings.rs` declined to
//! re-implement that kind of rule for the same reason, in the comment on
//! its `KEYS` list: "re-implementing Claude Code's whole merge algorithm
//! would be a second source of truth for someone else's behaviour, and
//! wrong the moment it changes."
//!
//! Deduping by name -- first wins, or project-beats-user -- is exactly
//! that second source of truth, and it is worse here than in
//! `settings.rs` would have been: a dropped definition leaves no trace
//! at all, so a wrong precedence rule does not render a wrong winner, it
//! renders a definition the user can see on disk as simply absent.
//!
//! This module has not MEASURED Claude Code's shadowing rule, so it
//! asserts none. Both definitions are listed, and a [`Collision`] names
//! every source that claimed the name so the user can resolve it
//! themselves against the tool that actually decides.
//!
//! ## Unreadable stays per scope
//!
//! The "what could not be read is reported" rule above does not survive
//! a multi-root scan by itself: flattening every root's `unreadable`
//! into one list loses WHICH scope was walled off, and a project whose
//! `.claude/` is unreadable hides an unknown number of definitions that
//! a successful user scan would otherwise paper over. So a refusal
//! travels with its [`Source`], the way `settings::ScopeRefusal` carries
//! its `Origin`.
//!
//! Read-only. Nothing here creates, edits, enables or deletes a
//! definition.
