//! Consuming `~/.claude/headstate/sessions.jsonl`, the file the hook
//! appends to (#913, writer in #912).
//!
//! The hook runs inside a 1.5 second budget and does exactly one thing:
//! serialise a record and append it. Everything expensive belongs here,
//! because this side has no budget over it -- validating a payload
//! against disk, resolving a start time, writing rows.
//!
//! # Byte offsets, not a filesystem watcher
//!
//! `notify` is not a dependency, and adding one would buy the exact
//! failure mode the epic forbids: a dead FSEvents stream reports "no new
//! sessions" indistinguishably from "the watch died", and on macOS a
//! stream dies silently. Polling's failure mode is legible -- if the tick
//! stops, the log stops with it.
//!
//! So consumption is a stored byte offset. Each pass opens the file,
//! seeks to the offset, reads what is new, and advances. A pass over an
//! unchanged file reads zero bytes and costs one `stat`.
//!
//! # The four things that can happen to a file between passes
//!
//! Each of these is a distinct case with a distinct answer, and getting
//! any of them wrong loses records silently:
//!
//! 1. **It grew.** The normal case: read from the offset to the end.
//! 2. **It SHRANK.** Someone truncated or replaced it -- our own
//!    rotation below, or a user clearing it by hand. The offset now
//!    points past the end, or worse into the middle of a different
//!    record. Detected by comparing the file's length against the stored
//!    offset, and answered by resetting the offset to zero and re-reading
//!    from the start. See [`Offset::advance`] on why re-reading is safe.
//! 3. **It ends mid-line.** A hook's single `write` is atomic, so this
//!    cannot be a torn record -- but a file can still be read at the
//!    moment between two appends, and a reader that assumed the last
//!    byte was a newline would either drop the last record or parse half
//!    of one. Answered by consuming only up to the last newline and
//!    leaving the remainder for the next pass.
//! 4. **It is gone.** Reported as "nothing to read" rather than as an
//!    error, because a missing handoff file is what a machine with the
//!    hook not yet installed looks like. Distinguished from an
//!    unreadable one, which IS an error.
//!
//! # Rotation truncates AFTER the commit, never before
//!
//! The ordering is the whole safety property. Records are read, written
//! to the database inside one transaction, the transaction commits, and
//! only then is the file truncated. If truncation came first, a crash
//! between the two would lose every record in the window; as ordered, a
//! crash means the next pass re-reads records that are already stored,
//! and the upsert makes that a no-op.
//!
//! That is why rotation is the CONSUMER's job and not the hook's. A hook
//! that truncated on a size threshold could drop a record this side had
//! never seen, and it cannot know which ones those are.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero
//!
//! A line that will not parse is COUNTED in [`Consumed::unparseable`],
//! never skipped. A record with an unknown `v` is counted separately, in
//! [`Consumed::unknown_version`], because that is a different problem
//! with a different remedy: the hook on disk is newer than this reader,
//! which happens because the installed hook command line keeps running
//! whatever binary is at that path across an app upgrade. A read failure
//! is an `Err`, never an empty list -- see `caches/mod.rs:550`.

    /// Proven against [`OldRecord`], a struct that genuinely does not have
    /// the new fields, rather than asserted about one. Three things are
    /// checked, and only the three together mean anything:
    ///
    /// 1. The parse SUCCEEDS. Serde ignores unknown fields by default, and
    ///    this is the test that keeps that true -- adding
    ///    `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to the live `Record` would be a
    ///    one-word change that silently made every new record unreadable
    ///    to every old Headstate.
    /// 2. The fields the old reader DOES know still arrive, with the right
    ///    values. A parse that succeeded but zeroed the session id would
    ///    be a crash by another name.
    /// 3. The version is still `1`, so the old reader's strict-equality
    ///    gate in [`parse_line`] lets the line through at all. This is the
    ///    assertion that would fail if someone bumped [`RECORD_VERSION`]
    ///    to carry the new fields -- which is the mistake the constant's
    ///    docs exist to prevent.
    ///
    /// PROVEN BY SABOTAGE, three ways, because the three assertions guard
    /// different mistakes:
    ///
    /// - Adding `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` to `OldRecord` (standing
    ///   in for a live `Record` that had it) fails (1):
    ///   `unknown field 'error_type', expected one of 'v', 'event', ...`.
    /// - Changing `hook::record_from` to drop `session_id` fails (2).
    /// - Bumping `hook::RECORD_VERSION` to 2 fails (3) -- and, tellingly,
    ///   fails `the_gate_lets_a_new_format_record_through` below with
    ///   `unknown_version: 1`, which is the whole record rejected rather
    ///   than just its new fields.
