//! Which sessions are subagents, and which session spawned each one
//! (#1002, epic #910).
//!
//! #914 already excludes one shape of subagent transcript: the files
//! under `<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/`, by a structural one-level
//! walk. That exclusion is correct and untouched -- re-measured here
//! before a line of this module was written:
//!
//! ```text
//! claude_session rows whose transcript_path is under subagents/   0
//! ```
//!
//! The rows this module is about arrive by a **different shape
//! entirely**. They are full, independent sessions -- their own session
//! id, their own resumable transcript one level under the project slug --
//! that merely RAN inside a worktree an agent owned. Nothing about the
//! transcript's location marks them, so #914's walk cannot see them and
//! should not try.
//!
//! # What actually marks them, measured
//!
//! Against the real store on the development machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! claude_session rows                                          1524
//! cwd under <repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<hex>                391   (25.7%)
//! distinct agent worktrees                                      107
//! ```
//!
//! A quarter of the list. With one live session the rows immediately
//! below it are that session's own machinery rather than the user's past
//! work, which is what #1002 reports from use.
//!
//! ## Why the cwd and not the branch or `isSidechain`
//!
//! Three candidate markers, measured against each other:
//!
//! ```text
//! marker                        matches   of 391   false positives
//! cwd is an agent worktree          391    100%          --
//! git_branch worktree-agent-%       102     26%           0
//! isSidechain == true                 0      0%          --
//! ```
//!
//! **`isSidechain` is `false`** in these transcripts. In Claude Code's own
//! model they are not sidechains; they are real sessions that happen to
//! run in an agent's tree. There is no ready-made flag to read.
//!
//! **The branch is good corroboration and a bad primary.** Zero rows
//! carry a `worktree-agent-` branch with a non-agent cwd -- so a match is
//! never wrong -- but it is present on only 102 of 391, so keying on it
//! would miss three quarters of them. [`Kind::classify`] therefore reads
//! the cwd, and nothing else.
//!
//! **The cwd is structural**, like #914's walk: `.claude/worktrees/` is a
//! path this repo's own agent tooling creates, and the marker is the
//! SHAPE of the path rather than a heuristic on the session's title. A
//! title match would break the first time a user named a session
//! "subagent notes"; re-measured, all 391 cwds are exactly
//! `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>` with nothing nested below.
//!
//! # Finding the parent, and the limit that decided where this runs
//!
//! A child's cwd carries an agent id. The session that SPAWNED that agent
//! names the id in its own transcript. So the map is built by reading the
//! corpus and recording, per agent id, which sessions mention it and
//! when.
//!
//! ## The bounded read that does not work, measured
//!
//! #959's usage rollup reads at most 8 MB per transcript, which covers
//! 98.9% of the corpus whole. The obvious move is to reuse that budget
//! here. **It does not work, and the measurement is the reason this
//! module runs where it does.** On the largest real parent (32.0 MB, 52
//! distinct agent ids mentioned), by byte offset of each id's FIRST
//! mention:
//!
//! ```text
//! ids whose first mention is within  1 MB    0 / 52
//! ids whose first mention is within  4 MB    7 / 52
//! ids whose first mention is within  8 MB   15 / 52   <- #959's budget
//! ids whose first mention is within 16 MB   25 / 52
//! ids whose first mention is within 32 MB   52 / 52
//! ```
//!
//! Median first-mention offset is 17.4 MB. Unlike usage -- which is on
//! every assistant record and so is sampled fairly by any prefix -- a
//! spawn happens once, at whatever moment the parent decided to delegate,
//! and those moments are spread across the whole session. An 8 MB budget
//! would resolve 29% of the ids and silently report the rest as
//! unattributed, which is a confident wrong answer in the shape this epic
//! exists to remove: the UI would say "we could not tell" about parents
//! it simply declined to finish reading.
//!
//! So the pass is unbounded per file, and therefore expensive.
//!
//! ## Measured cost, and why it is in the SCAN and not the poll
//!
//! Over the real corpus, release build, warm cache:
//!
//! ```text
//! transcripts read                             1523
//! bytes                                  923,537,430   (0.86 GB)
//! whole-corpus pass                             1.37 s
//! ```
//!
//! 1.37 s is far too much for the session list's 10-second poll, which
//! must stay responsive and already re-derives liveness for every row. It
//! is affordable exactly once, in the same place #914's scan already
//! reads every one of these files: [`crate::claude::transcript::scan`],
//! which runs at startup and behind the rescan button and already costs
//! ~200 ms warm / ~1 s cold. The map is built there, stored, and READ by
//! the poll -- so the poll pays a SQL read, not a corpus read.
//!
//! That is the whole reason [`Map`] is a value the scan produces rather
//! than something [`crate::claude::sessions::list`] derives.
//!
//! # The ambiguous ids, and why they stay unattributed
//!
//! A parent transcript can quote ANOTHER session's agent ids -- a session
//! that reports on other agents' work mentions their ids in its own
//! records, and a grep result listing files inside an agent worktree
//! mentions the id incidentally. So "mentions the id" alone is not
//! "spawned it", and on the real corpus 29 ids are mentioned by more than
//! one session.
//!
//! **Earliest mention disambiguates.** The first session to mention an id
//! is the one that spawned it; every later mention is somebody discussing
//! it after the fact. Validated against ground truth -- four agents known
//! to have been spawned by session `e5dff3bd`:
//!
//! ```text
//! agent-ad12506fcee31848a  earliest mention e5dff3bd 02:23:29   CORRECT
//! agent-a6b88abdad5cabfce  earliest mention e5dff3bd 02:23:58   CORRECT
//! ```
//!
//! (The other two ids in that ground-truth set are agents that never
//! produced a session row, so there is no child to attribute and they are
//! not in the map's domain at all.)
//!
//! Two rules keep this from turning a guess into a claim:
//!
//! 1. **A session never adopts itself.** A child's own transcript carries
//!    its own agent id in its own `gitBranch`, and it is always the
//!    earliest mention of it. Counting that would make every subagent its
//!    own parent. [`Map::parent_of`] excludes the child's own sessions.
//! 2. **A TIE is unattributed.** Where the earliest mention is not
//!    strictly earlier than the runner-up, earliest-mention has not
//!    decided anything, and the child stays [`Parent::Unattributed`]. A
//!    wrong rollup is worse than no rollup -- the same rule
//!    `caches/mod.rs:550` states about absent-is-not-zero, applied to
//!    attribution.
//!
//! Records with no timestamp are skipped rather than ordered by byte
//! position, because byte position across two different files is not a
//! comparison at all.

/// 2. A `gh pr create` Bash call whose SUCCESSFUL result carries the new
///    pull request's URL. Measured for #1545 on the owner's corpus: 1,021
///    PRs were created through `gh pr create` with a URL in the result,
///    and 8 main-session ones have no `pr-link` record -- most likely
///    written by Claude Code versions older than the record.
///
/// # Why the second source is precise
///
/// It needs BOTH halves: an assistant `tool_use` of the `Bash` tool whose
/// command contains `gh pr create`, and the `tool_result` with that same
/// `tool_use_id`. The result counts only when it is not `is_error` and
/// exactly ONE of its lines is a bare pull request URL, which is what
/// `gh pr create` prints on success. A failed create ("a pull request for
/// branch ... already exists: URL") is an error result, and a result
/// with two bare URLs is ambiguous -- both are skipped rather than
/// guessed at. A command that merely MENTIONS the phrase in a PR body
/// prints a comment or view URL, not a bare `.../pull/N` line.
///
/// # Why it is cheap
///
/// Every line pays two substring tests at most. A line is parsed only if
/// it contains `gh pr create` and `"tool_use"`, or -- only while a create
/// is pending -- `"tool_result"` and `/pull/`. The `pr-link` gate is the
/// one [`pr_link_in`] already had.
///
/// The pending set is per FILE: a `tool_use_id` is only meaningful inside
/// the transcript that issued it. An incremental read that stops between
/// a create and its result loses that pairing, and the `pr-link` record is
/// what still links it; see `claude::linkscan`.
