//! Writing imported transcripts into `claude_session` (#914).
//!
//! Migration 11 (`store/schema.rs`) created the tables; this is the first
//! thing to write to them.
//!
//! # Why an upsert, and why on `session_id`
//!
//! `session_id` is the primary key because it is the one stable identity
//! a session has: a `claude --resume` or `--continue` reuses the SAME id
//! with a new pid, and only a fresh start mints a new one (measured, epic
//! #910 §1.2). It is also sound as a cross-source key -- across the real
//! corpus the transcript filename equals the body's `sessionId` for all
//! 1,430 files, and no id appears in two project directories.
//!
//! So a full rescan is idempotent by construction. Running it twice
//! produces the same rows, which is what lets #914 skip every piece of
//! incremental machinery: there is no offset to keep, and re-importing
//! costs one UPSERT per session.
//!
//! # The merge rule: transcript wins on `cwd`
//!
//! The two sources know different things, and the ONE field they disagree
//! about has a known-correct answer:
//!
//! | Field | Authority | Why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `cwd`, `git_branch`, `claude_version`, `transcript_path` | **transcript** | ground truth on disk |
//! | `name` | first non-empty, user's rename last | see below |
//! | `first_seen_at` | earliest of the two | |
//! | `last_activity_at` | latest of the two | |
//! | pid, `source`, `end_reason`, `ended_at` | hook only (`claude_run`) | the transcript has none of them |
//!
//! The transcript winning on `cwd` is not a tie-break preference, it is a
//! bug fix: a `SessionStart` hook can receive a STALE `session_id` and
//! `transcript_path` from the previous session after `/exit` then
//! `--continue` (Claude Code upstream issue 9188). A hook-recorded `cwd` can
//! therefore be the wrong directory, and re-reading disk corrects it.
//! Preferring the stored value would preserve the lie indefinitely,
//! because nothing else ever revisits it.
//!
//! # What an import must NOT do
//!
//! It must not write `claude_run`. A transcript proves a session existed;
//! it cannot prove a pid or how a run ended, and migration 11 declares
//! `claude_run.pid` `NOT NULL` precisely so that an unobserved process
//! cannot be recorded as an observed one. A transcript-only session
//! therefore has zero runs, which the liveness layer reports as unknown
//! rather than dead -- honest, because we never watched that process.
