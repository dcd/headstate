//! Stopping a Claude Code session Headstate is already tracking (#1219).
//!
//! # Why Headstate intervenes at all
//!
//! [`super`]'s header is a rule about **writing to `~/.claude`**, and
//! signalling a process is not that. But the module's spirit is
//! "Headstate does not intervene in Claude Code", and this intervenes --
//! so reading that header as permission would be wrong, and the case is
//! made here on its own terms.
//!
//! Headstate already tells the user a session auto-compacted repeatedly
//! ([`super::signals::Compactions`]), that its tools are failing in a
//! concentrated pattern, that it has waited for hours
//! ([`super::signals::Waiting`]), and that the machine is oversubscribed
//! (`health::runaway`). It surfaces every input to "should I stop this"
//! and then makes the user re-find, in Activity Monitor or a terminal, **a
//! pid Headstate already holds**. That gap is not neutrality; it is the
//! single-pane-of-glass promise breaking at exactly the moment the pane
//! has done its job.
//!
//! The intervention is the narrowest one available: signalling a process
//! the user owns, on the machine in front of them, with the evidence shown
//! and the action PROPOSED rather than taken. Editing files Claude Code
//! owns remains out of bounds and nothing here does it.
//!
//! # `Class::Local`, and the phone cannot reach it
//!
//! `remote/surface.rs` classes `claude_stop_session` as `Class::Local` and
//! gives it **no dispatch arm**, so the stop does not cross the remote
//! wire. The class's own test is whether the phone could act on the
//! answer, and a phone cannot see or use a terminated process on a Mac it
//! is not sitting at. `Destructive` was considered and rejected: a stopped
//! session keeps its transcript and can be resumed, so a step-up signature
//! would be friction disproportionate to a recoverable action -- and would
//! make the genuinely irreversible actions feel routine by association.
//!
//! # SIGTERM first, and never a bare SIGKILL
//!
//! [`super::registry`]'s header records the measurement: a SIGKILLed
//! session **leaves its registry file behind** with `status` frozen at
//! `"busy"`, and `SessionEnd` never fires. Confirmed by experiment -- the
//! file was still there twenty seconds later, not a late reap. The user
//! gets no record of what the session was mid-way through.
//!
//! So [`Escalation`] is SIGTERM, then a bounded wait, then SIGKILL only if
//! the process is still there -- and the caller is told, in
//! [`StopOutcome::signal`], which one actually ended it. There is no path
//! through this module that sends SIGKILL first;
//! `sigterm_is_always_sent_before_any_escalation` pins that.
//!
//! # The pid is re-derived AT THE MOMENT of the stop
//!
//! The session list is ten seconds stale (`CLAUDE_POLL_MS`), and reading a
//! pid from it and signalling that is how you kill a process that
//! INHERITED the pid. `caches/mod.rs`'s `remove_venv` states the rule for
//! deletions -- "every check runs against the filesystem rather than the
//! row the user clicked" -- and this is the same rule for a signal.
//!
//! [`confirm`] therefore re-reads `~/.claude/sessions/` and re-probes the
//! process table on this call, and pairs the two with
//! [`super::liveness::START_TOLERANCE_SECS`] exactly as
//! [`super::liveness::derive`] does. That pairing is not reinvented here;
//! reinventing it would give the machine two answers to "is this the same
//! process" that drift apart the first time either changes.
//!
//! **If the start time cannot be confirmed, that is `Unknown` and the stop
//! is REFUSED.** Not deferred, not attempted on a guess. The failure this
//! prevents is destroying someone's unrelated work, and the only safe
//! direction for an unconfirmable pid is to do nothing and say why.
//!
//! # Proposed with evidence, never acted on unattended
//!
//! #1141's `cleanup::propose` is a better shape than a confirmation
//! dialog, and this follows it: [`propose`] returns [`StopProposal`]s
//! carrying their evidence, under a per-run blast-radius cap
//! ([`MAX_PER_RUN`]), with `"proposed"`, `"refused"` and `"skipped"`
//! first-class in the ledger. A refusal is a ROW, not a dropped entry --
//! a stop that keeps being passed over is something the user must be able
//! to see.
//!
//! Per `health::runaway`'s Notice-vs-Alert framing, a stuck session is an
//! INDICATOR and not a recommendation. Nothing in this module decides that
//! a session should be stopped; it states what is true about one and lets
//! the user decide.
