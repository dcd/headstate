//! Is this session still running? (#917, epic #910.)
//!
//! Three answers, never two. [`Liveness::Running`],
//! [`Liveness::Dead`] and [`Liveness::Unknown`] -- and the third is the
//! reason this module exists rather than being a one-line `ps` check.
//!
//! # Why derived, and never stored
//!
//! Migration 11 has no `status` column on purpose, and its comment says
//! why: `SessionEnd` does not fire on SIGKILL, a closed terminal, a
//! crash or an OS reap. A stored flag would read "running" forever for
//! exactly the sessions a user wants to resurrect, with nothing to
//! correct it. So liveness is asked of the machine every time a row is
//! rendered.
//!
//! # Why `Unknown` is mandatory, not defensive padding
//!
//! `Unknown` is what a check that could not be COMPLETED returns. It is
//! not a shade of `Dead`, and collapsing the two is #841's `is_some_and`
//! fail-open in another costume: the UI offers Resume on a session it
//! believes is not running, so a failed probe rendered as "not running"
//! offers resurrection for a session that may be alive and mid-work.
//! Resuming a session that is already running starts a SECOND copy of
//! it, so the wrong answer here is not cosmetic.
//!
//! `SystemHealthPage`'s `HealthConditions` is the house pattern on the
//! rendering side -- it renders "nothing found", "could not look" and
//! "have not looked recently" as three different things. This is the
//! same rule one layer down, in the type rather than in the component,
//! so a caller cannot accidentally treat the third as the second.
//!
//! `Unknown` carries its REASON as a string, because the remedies
//! differ: a `0700` registry directory is a permission problem, an
//! unparseable `procStart` is a Claude Code format change, and a session
//! we simply never observed a process for is neither.
//!
//! # Two sources, and why both
//!
//! ```text
//! ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json   the LIVE registry -- one file per session
//! claude_run (migration 11)       what the hook recorded, if it ran
//! ```
//!
//! The registry is the better source and it needs no hook installed at
//! all: one small file per session carrying `pid`, `sessionId`,
//! `procStart`, `cwd`, `name` and `status`. Measured on the development
//! machine: three registry files, three live `claude` processes, exact
//! correspondence.
//!
//! It is also, measured, NOT reaped on SIGKILL -- a killed session
//! leaves its file behind with `status` frozen at the moment of death
//! (epic #910, the orphan probe). So an entry whose pid is gone is a
//! POSITIVE crash signal, which is strictly better than inferring a
//! crash from a missing `SessionEnd`, since absence is also what a
//! still-running session looks like.
//!
//! # The failure events are NOT a source here, and must not become one
//!
//! Epic #1060 added three events (#1062, #1063, #1064) recording why a
//! turn died, which tools failed and what auto mode denied. None of them
//! belongs in this derivation, and the temptation is real: a turn that
//! died of a rate limit reads like evidence the session is over.
//!
//! It is not. `StopFailure` does not fire on SIGKILL -- the founding
//! measurement of this whole epic -- and a rate-limited session is very
//! much still running, so consulting it would report a live session as
//! dead. A denial is further still from an ending: it is a guardrail
//! doing its job while the session carries on.
//!
//! The separation is structural rather than remembered. Those events live
//! in `claude_hook_event`, this derivation is handed only `&[Run]` rows,
//! and
//! `invariants.rs`'s `liveness_never_reads_the_failure_events` fails on
//! any code in this file that reaches for them.
//!
//! `claude_run` is consulted for sessions the registry does not mention,
//! because #913 will populate it from the hook and a run whose pid the
//! registry has forgotten is still a run we once observed.
//!
//! # A complete registry listing that does not mention a session (#984)
//!
//! MEASURED on the real corpus, after #947 put `claude_poll_live` on the
//! 60-second timer, by `sessions::tests::real_session_list`:
//!
//! ```text
//! rows returned  1491
//! liveness  running 1  dead 0  unknown 1490
//! ```
//!
//! `Dead` matched **no row at all**, and structurally could not: every
//! session here was imported from a transcript, migration 11's
//! `claude_run.pid NOT NULL` forbids an import from fabricating a run,
//! and a session that ran before the hook was installed can never
//! acquire a pid retroactively. So the `runs.is_empty()` arm below WAS
//! the whole list, and it returned `Unknown` -- "could not tell" on
//! 1,490 of 1,491 rows, while `overview::aggregate` called 183 of the
//! same rows resumable on the strength of the same registry read. Two
//! pages, one database, contradictory answers.
//!
//! The overview's reading is the one consistent with this module's own
//! evidence, and the fix is to adopt it here rather than add a third:
//! **once `failure` is `None` and `unreadable` is empty, a registry
//! listing that does not mention a session is positive evidence that it
//! is not running.** `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json` exists for every
//! running session and survives a SIGKILL (measured, epic #910), and
//! `read_registry` already treats an absent directory as a settled empty
//! answer rather than a failure -- `an_absent_registry_directory_is_not_a_failure`
//! states the same rule as a test.
//!
//! This does NOT weaken `Unknown`, and the ordering is what guarantees
//! that: `registry.failure` and a non-empty `registry.unreadable` are
//! still checked FIRST and still return `Unknown`, so the inference only
//! ever applies to a listing we read completely. A registry we could not
//! read still poisons every row, which is the direction that matters --
//! a wrong `Dead` offers a confident Resume that starts a second copy.
//!
//! The `why` strings stay distinct, because the evidence is not equally
//! strong. A `Dead` from probing a recorded pid is a fact about a
//! process; a `Dead` from registry absence is an inference from one
//! file's absence, and [`Liveness::Dead`] is rendered with its `why` for
//! exactly that reason.
//!
//! # A running session that publishes only a `.key` (#1315)
//!
//! The #984 inference above rests on "every running session publishes a
//! `<pid>.json`", and that premise is FALSE for a session started from a
//! terminal -- every Claudify or resume launch. Measured (#1304, and
//! again for #1315 with a bare interactive `claude`):
//!
//! ```text
//! ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json          ABSENT
//! ~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.<hash>.key    PRESENT, the process alive
//! ```
//!
//! The `.key` is `{"peerToken","procStart","pidDomain"}` and nothing
//! else. It carries **no `sessionId`**, and there is no other file that
//! names one: a bare interactive session has not even written a
//! transcript until its first prompt, so pid -> transcript is not a
//! matching problem we could solve with more cleverness, it is a record
//! that does not exist yet. So such a session CANNOT be named, and this
//! module never invents a name for it -- no `Running` verdict is ever
//! issued from a `.key`.
//!
//! What it does instead is refuse to let the missing record masquerade
//! as a settled `Dead`. A `.key` with no sibling `.json` becomes a
//! [`UnnamedRecord`]; [`unnamed_sessions`] checks it with the same
//! `(pid, procStart)` pairing and [`START_TOLERANCE_SECS`] as every
//! other arm (a false positive would invite someone to kill an unrelated
//! process); and any row whose verdict would be `Dead` while a live
//! unnamed session could be it is returned as `Unknown`, naming the pid.
//! A `.key` whose process is gone, or whose pid now belongs to a
//! different process, says nothing: that is ordinary cleanup.
//!
//! **Narrowed by working directory, and why that is sound.** Without a
//! narrowing, one Claudify launch would put all ~1,400 historical rows
//! back into `Unknown` -- #984's regression, reintroduced by the one
//! event this feature exists to support. A session's process runs in
//! its project directory and Claude Code keeps its shell inside that
//! tree, so a live unnamed process can only be a row whose recorded cwd
//! is the same directory, an ancestor, or a descendant of the process's
//! own. Every uncertainty falls toward `Unknown` rather than `Dead`: a
//! process cwd we could not read, or a row with no recorded cwd,
//! matches everything.
//!
//! **Named, when a hook-recorded run says which session it is (#1534).**
//! The `.key` has no session id, but the `SessionStart` hook records
//! `(session_id, pid)`, and the live pass stores the `.key`'s confirmed
//! start time on that run. A live `.key`-only process whose start time
//! EXACTLY matches one session's un-ended run is that session: its row is
//! `Running`, and it stops hedging its neighbours. [`Unnamed`] carries the
//! rule and what does not count; anything short of an exact, unambiguous
//! match leaves the process unnamed.
//!
//! The overview page counts from the session list since #1534, so it
//! shows exactly these verdicts; the old `live.rs` seam, which offered
//! Resume on rows this module hedged, is gone.
//!
//! # `(pid, pid_start_time)`, never a pid alone
//!
//! Pids are recycled. A bare "is 14779 alive" is true about whatever
//! process holds that number now, so a long-dead session whose number
//! was reissued would render as Running -- the same fail-open
//! `health/runaway.rs` already pairs `(pid, start_time)` to defeat, and
//! migration 11's comment states as the reason `pid_start_time` exists.
//!
//! A pid we found but whose start time we cannot compare is
//! [`Liveness::Unknown`], never `Running`: it is indistinguishable from
//! a reused pid.
//!
//! # The format trap that would mark every session dead
//!
//! Measured on this machine, the same instant in both places:
//!
//! ```text
//! registry procStart: Fri Sep 11 09:43:48 2026     (month day, UTC)
//! ps      lstart:     Fri 11 Sep 05:43:48 2026     (day month, LOCAL)
//! ```
//!
//! TWO differences -- field order and timezone, four hours apart in
//! `America/New_York`. A string comparison fails. So does a parse that
//! fixes the field order and ignores the zone. Both fail in the same
//! direction, marking every session dead, and the feature still LOOKS
//! correct because dead-but-resumable is the expected state for 84% of
//! rows. `procstart_is_utc_however_it_is_spelled` and
//! `a_string_comparison_of_the_two_formats_would_call_everything_dead`
//! pin it.
//!
//! This module never parses `ps` output. It compares the registry's
//! `procStart` against `sysinfo`'s `start_time()`, which is epoch
//! seconds and has no format at all -- the trap is in the TEXT, so the
//! fix is to leave the text behind. `procStart` is parsed once, as UTC,
//! with an explicit tolerance (see [`START_TOLERANCE_SECS`]).
