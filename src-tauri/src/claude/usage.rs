//! How much work happened inside one session, summed from its own
//! transcript (#959, epic #941).
//!
//! The session detail answers where a session ran -- its directory, its
//! branch, its Claude version, its id. Nothing answered how much work
//! happened inside it, which is the question a user has when deciding
//! which of 1,475 rows is worth resuming.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all, after #910 cut it
//!
//! #910's UI design cut tokens with a stated reason: *"not in the data I
//! verified -- `aiTitle` and timestamps are, usage is not, and I will not
//! design a chart for a field I have not seen"*. That was correct on the
//! evidence it had: the field list it worked from (`sessionId`, `cwd`,
//! `gitBranch`, `version`, `entrypoint`, `userType`, `uuid`,
//! `parentUuid`, `isSidechain`) genuinely carries no usage.
//!
//! The premise was falsifiable and #959 falsified it. **Re-measured here
//! before writing a line of this module**, against the real
//! `~/.claude/projects` on the development machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! session transcripts (one level down)    1502
//! carrying "cache_read_input_tokens"      1478   (98.4%)
//! carrying a "cost-state" record            43   ( 2.9%)
//! ```
//!
//! So `assistant.message.usage` is present on 98.4% of sessions and the
//! pre-computed `cost-state` rollup on 2.9%. That ratio decides the
//! design: the per-message sum is the source, and `cost-state` cannot be
//! -- a panel that appeared on 43 rows and vanished on 1,459 would be
//! worse than no panel.
//!
//! # What is shown, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! **Tokens, not dollars.** A dollar figure needs per-model rates, those
//! rates change, and this app cannot keep a hardcoded table true. A cost
//! that is quietly wrong is exactly the confident-wrong-answer failure
//! #941 is about, with a currency symbol in front of it to make it look
//! authoritative. Tokens are what the file actually records, and they
//! stay true for as long as the file does.
//!
//! ## Computing a figure, and transcribing one (#1210)
//!
//! The paragraph above is untouched and still governs: **nothing here
//! multiplies a token count by a rate.** No rate table ships, and none
//! ever will, for exactly the reason it gives.
//!
//! What it does not govern is a number the vendor already computed and
//! wrote to the file. A `cost-state` record carries `totalCostUSD`,
//! measured by Claude Code itself at the time the session ran. Reading
//! that and reading `output_tokens` are the same act: both transcribe a
//! field the transcript states. Neither is an estimate, because neither
//! involves a rate this app would have to keep true.
//!
//! The distinction survives only if the label carries it, so
//! [`CostState`] is never rendered as "cost" unqualified. It is rendered
//! **attributed** -- "as recorded by Claude Code" -- because a figure
//! this app transcribed and a figure this app derived have different
//! failure modes and a reader has to be able to tell which one is on
//! screen.
//!
//! And it is attached per SESSION, never summed across the corpus. The
//! record is on 6.1% of sessions lifetime (88 of 1,453 re-measured for
//! #1210, up from the 43 recorded above). A corpus total over 6% of the
//! rows would be read as a total over all of them no matter what
//! denominator sat beside it -- the confident-wrong-answer failure at
//! aggregate scale. One session's panel states one session's record, and
//! the sessions without one say so in words.
//!
//! The four counters are reported SEPARATELY rather than as one total,
//! because they are not interchangeable. Measured on the four newest
//! sessions:
//!
//! ```text
//! session    assistant msgs   input     output    cache read   cache created
//! e5dff3bd            994      1,988    582,035  405,086,242       4,971,059
//! be0086f0              5         15      2,561      124,237          87,002
//! 0933a8ae             12         22      8,740      681,092          96,687
//! 4c657815              4         14        824      111,124          16,006
//! ```
//!
//! Cache reads are two to three orders of magnitude above fresh input on
//! every one of them. Summing all four into one "tokens" figure would
//! produce a number dominated entirely by cache reads and would tell a
//! reader nothing about how much was actually written.
//!
//! # The byte budget, and why it is stated on screen
//!
//! Measured size distribution over the same 1,502 transcripts:
//!
//! ```text
//! median      183,237 bytes (179 KB)
//! p90             464 KB
//! p99            11.4 MB
//! max          76,740,099 bytes  (one file, 8.4% of the 916 MB corpus)
//! over  1 MB       39 files (2.6%)
//! over 10 MB       16 files (1.1%)
//! ```
//!
//! A whole-file read is therefore wrong for the tail: 76 MB handed to a
//! line-by-line JSON parse is how the app hangs on one row. So this reads
//! at most [`BUDGET_BYTES`] and SAYS when it stopped early -- a sum
//! labelled as covering the first 8 MB is a true statement, and the same
//! sum unlabelled is a false one.
//!
//! Measured cost with the budget in place: the 40 newest transcripts
//! rolled up in 0.05 s (23 MB read), and the 76.7 MB monster in 0.024 s.
//! That is ~1.2 ms for the worst row on the machine, which is why this is
//! affordable per session detail and still must never join the startup
//! scan -- 1,502 of them would be the 3.8 s whole-corpus read
//! `transcript.rs` exists to avoid.
//!
//! # The selected session reads whole (#1086)
//!
//! The paragraph above draws the right distinction and the code then
//! applied the bound to both halves of it. A user who SELECTS a session
//! was shown "these are floors, not totals: the transcript is 40.4 MB and
//! only its first 8.0 MB were read" -- a partial answer, concentrated
//! exactly on the long sessions where "what did this cost" is a real
//! question.
//!
//! So there are two entry points, and the difference between them is the
//! bound and nothing else:
//!
//! - [`summarise`] -- the BULK path. Capped at [`BUDGET_BYTES`], used by
//!   `sessions::subagent_rollup`, which reads one transcript per
//!   attributed child. The 3.8 s whole-corpus figure is why this stays.
//! - [`summarise_whole`] -- ONE file, on demand, behind an explicit user
//!   selection. No cap, `truncated` false by construction, so the notice
//!   disappears rather than being suppressed.
//!
//! `Usage::observed` is unchanged and still load-bearing on both: 24 of
//! 1,502 sessions carry no usage block at all, and reading whole must not
//! turn "we found none" into a measured zero.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero
//!
//! 24 of 1,502 sessions carry no usage block at all. `messages == 0` is
//! what that looks like, and [`Usage::observed`] is how a caller tells it
//! from a session whose messages summed to zero -- which cannot happen,
//! since every one of the 13,425 usage blocks sampled carried all four
//! counters. A token count of 0 rendered as a measurement would be a
//! confident wrong answer with a credible shape, which is the rule
//! `caches/mod.rs:550` states and `Tile`'s `value: number | null` already
//! implements one page over.

/// run orders of magnitude above fresh input over a session's life, so

/// argument is about sums over MANY messages and does not reach this

///
/// On the first message the three fields are not three kinds of work.
/// They are one context, split by how the cache happened to serve it: a
/// token read from cache and a token sent fresh were both in the window
/// the model saw, and which bucket a given token landed in reflects
/// whether a previous session warmed the cache. Reporting them apart
/// would invite reading the split as composition, which is exactly what
/// this must not do.
///
/// # Why there is NO per-source breakdown, and never will be
///
/// #1242 tested three routes to attributing this sum to the system
/// prompt, the tools and `CLAUDE.md`, and all three fail:
///
/// 1. **The cache TTL split does not decompose context.** The hypothesis
///    was that `ephemeral_1h` holds stable context and `ephemeral_5m`
///    per-turn work. Re-measured for #1248 over the same corpus:
///    `1h` only on 63, `5m` only on 1,230, **both on 0**, neither on
///    201. Zero sessions use both, so the split reports which caching
///    strategy ran, not what the context contained.
/// 2. **A measured-on-disk proxy is an estimate beside measured
///    figures.** Sizing `CLAUDE.md` from its bytes and calling the
///    result its token cost is a derivation this app cannot keep true,
///    which is the argument the module docs already make about dollars,
///    one field along.
/// 3. **Contrast inference is suggestive, not attributive.** Sessions
///    whose `cwd` holds a `CLAUDE.md` showed a +3,228 token median
///    difference -- n=120 against n=1,366, no control for repository

    /// `spawn_blocking`, once. 160 ms is not a hang and it buys the
    /// difference between 1,250 messages and 16,748 -- the capped read of
    /// this session reported 7.5% of its messages as if that were the
