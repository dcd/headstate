//! Reading the Claude Code transcripts already on disk (#914, epic #910).
//!
//! Claude Code writes one JSONL transcript per session under
//! `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`. Those files are
//! the ONLY source of history for every session that started before
//! Headstate existed -- measured 1,430 of them on the development machine
//! -- so this module is what makes the Claude Code view open with real
//! content instead of an empty list.
//!
//! Read-only, and deliberately so. Nothing here writes, renames or
//! deletes inside `~/.claude`: those transcripts are Claude Code's data
//! and the file `claude --resume <id>` depends on. Losing one destroys
//! exactly the capability #910 exists to provide.
//!
//! # Three measured facts that shape every line below
//!
//! Each was run against the real corpus on the development machine; each
//! is a bug in the obvious implementation.
//!
//! ## 1. Half the `.jsonl` files are not sessions
//!
//! ```text
//! find ~/.claude/projects -name '*.jsonl'                       -> 2800
//! find ~/.claude/projects -name '*.jsonl' -path '*/subagents/*' -> 1370
//! <slug>/<uuid>.jsonl  (one level down, the real sessions)       -> 1430
//! ```
//!
//! (#914 quotes 2,797 / 1,368 / 1,433 from an earlier run on the same
//! machine. The corpus grows as sessions are used; the RATIO is the
//! finding and it is unchanged -- just under half the files are not
//! sessions.)
//!
//! Subagent transcripts live at `<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`
//! and deeper. They have no session id of their own and `claude --resume`
//! cannot open them. The obvious `**/*.jsonl` glob therefore roughly
//! DOUBLES the list with rows offering a resume handle for something that
//! was never a session.
//!
//! [`session_files`] reads exactly one level below each project slug, so
//! nothing under a nested directory can be reached at all --
//! `subagent_transcripts_are_not_sessions` proves it against the real
//! layout rather than trusting the depth arithmetic.
//!
//! ## 2. The metadata is never in the first record
//!
//! `cwd`, `gitBranch` and `version` sit behind bookkeeping records --
//! `queue-operation`, `last-prompt`, `mode`, `permission-mode`,
//! `atis-latch`. Measured first-appearance of `cwd`, over all 1,430
//! sessions:
//!
//! ```text
//! record 1:     0      <- NOT ONE FILE
//! record 3:  1354
//! record 4:    27
//! record 5:    21
//! record 6:    28      <- deepest observed
//! ```
//!
//! Zero. An importer that reads record 1 returns nothing for EVERY
//! session while appearing to work perfectly: the file opens, the JSON
//! parses, the loop completes, no error is raised anywhere. It ships as a
//! view full of blank rows and looks like a UI bug.
//!
//! So [`extract`] scans forward to the first record BEARING `cwd`, and
//! `metadata_is_not_in_the_first_record` is the regression test, written
//! so that a reader restricted to record 1 fails it.
//!
//! ## 3. The 40-record bound has to cover the title too
//!
//! The design's bound of 40 records was set for `cwd`, whose deepest
//! observed position is 6. But the human-readable name lives in an
//! `ai-title` record, which is written only once Claude has produced one
//! -- measured median position 10, p95 18, **deepest 33**, present for
//! 1,434 of 1,436 sessions.
//!
//! 40 therefore has 7 records of headroom over the worst real case and
//! covers both fields in one pass. It is a bound rather than a whole-file
//! read because the corpus is 881 MB: reading every file to the end would
//! turn a sub-second scan into a disk-bound one for two fields that are
//! always near the top.
//!
//! The two titleless sessions get [`None`], not their UUID dressed up as
//! a name -- naming is the caller's decision and a fabricated one here
//! would be indistinguishable from a real one.
//!
//! # Why a full rescan, and no incremental machinery
//!
//! Measured by `tests::real_corpus` against the real tree, release build:
//!
//! ```text
//! sessions found            1436
//! subagent .jsonl skipped   1370
//! elapsed              192-252 ms warm, ~1040 ms cold
//! metadata beyond record 1  1436
//! deepest cwd record           6
//! with an ai-title name     1434
//! with a last-activity time 1436   <- every one, after the tail retry
//! ```
//!
//! (The session count climbs as the machine is used -- it was 1,430 a few
//! hours earlier, and #914 quotes 1,433. Only the ratios and the
//! per-session facts are stable, which is why `real_corpus` asserts those
//! and prints the counts rather than asserting them.)
//!
//! Both numbers are stated because only one of them is the honest answer
//! to "what will the user feel". 192-252 ms is the warm-page-cache figure
//! over three consecutive runs; the FIRST scan after boot reads 881 MB of
//! cold file tails and takes about a second. The startup rescan is
//! therefore a ~1s background cost once per boot, not 200 ms, and quoting
//! only the warm figure would be picking the flattering measurement.
//!
//! Either way it is fast because each file costs a bounded head read plus
//! one 16 KB tail seek (rarely a second, wider one -- see
//! [`TAIL_BYTES_RETRY`]) and -- see the pre-filter in [`extract`] -- most
//! records are never handed to the JSON parser at all. At that price a
//! complete rescan at startup and behind a button is simpler AND more
//! correct than any cache: there is no stored offset to invalidate, no
//! watcher to fail silently, and a transcript edited behind our back is
//! picked up on the next pass. `notify` is not a dependency of this crate
//! and this module is the argument for not making it one.
//!
//! One correction to the design, which claimed 0.23s flat: the first cut
//! of this module measured **738 ms warm**, three times that, because the
//! first 40 records of the corpus are 260 MB -- an `assistant` record
//! carries whole message bodies -- and parsing all of them to read three
//! short strings dominates everything else. The pre-filter is what makes
//! the design's number real rather than aspirational, and `real_corpus`
//! prints the figure so the claim stays checkable on another machine
//! instead of resting on this comment.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero
//!
//! A [`Scan`] carries what it could not read as data, not as a log line.
//! An unreadable project directory, a file whose metadata could not be
//! extracted, a `~/.claude/projects` that is missing entirely -- each is
//! a distinct, counted, reportable outcome, because rendering any of them
//! as "no sessions" tells the user their history is gone when in fact we
//! failed to look. That is the defect class `caches/mod.rs:550` states
//! the house rule for and #841 shipped the fail-open version of.

/// to find the spawn records. That is 0.84 GB of reads and it is the
/// right price for a session list, which cannot be drawn without those
/// fields.
///
/// The content indexer needs NONE of them. [`super::search::index_pass`]
/// reads exactly three things off a [`Scan`]: each session's `path` and
/// `session_id`, and `unreadable_files`. It then takes its own
/// `fs::metadata` per session anyway, because the ledger is keyed on
/// `(size, mtime)`. Every other field the scan worked for is discarded

/// scan(), warm         878-935 ms   1,510 sessions, 0.84 GB
/// corpus(), warm        49- 60 ms   the same 1,510 sessions
/// ```
///
/// So the live pass was paying ~880 ms per tick for ~51 ms of
/// information. The difference is not the directory walk -- that is 15
/// ms of the 51 -- it is the 0.84 GB of file CONTENT the scan reads and
/// the indexer discards.
///
/// # Why this is not change detection
///
/// #1246 suggested detecting an unchanged corpus and skipping the walk.
/// That was aimed at the wrong cost. The walk and its stats are 15 ms;
/// the 829 ms is the per-file CONTENT reads. A directory mtime also does not
/// move when a transcript inside a project directory is appended to --
/// which is the ordinary case, since Claude Code appends to the session
/// you are in -- so the signal would have had to be a stat sweep of
/// every file, which is what this already is. Detecting "nothing
/// changed" to skip work that is already only 15 ms buys nothing and
/// adds a staleness bug.
///
/// # What it deliberately keeps
///
/// `unreadable_files` and the denominator, because the honesty property
/// in [`super::search`] rests on both. They are not weakened by
/// stopping early: [`extract`] returns `Err` only when a file cannot be
/// opened or its size cannot be read, and this performs BOTH of those
/// calls on every session file for exactly that reason -- so a
/// permission-walled transcript lands in `unreadable_files` here just
/// as it does there, and `is_complete()`'s third clause still sees it.
/// The body of the file is what goes unread, not the question of
/// whether it can be read at all. See the comment at the open below for
/// the version of this that got it wrong.
///
/// `sessions` carries a [`Transcript`] with only `session_id` and
