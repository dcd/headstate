//! The tail of one transcript, as conversation rather than as JSONL
//! (#982, epic #941).
//!
//! Before pasting `cd … && claude --resume 3a92d7c9-…`, the user wants to
//! check that this is the right session. Titles are not enough: 286 of
//! 1,438 sessions share a title with another and 147 do inside the
//! largest directory, mostly repeated `/security-review` runs. And on a
//! phone there is no path to the content at all -- `claude_reveal_path`
//! is `Class::Local`, so the companion user who can see that a session
//! died cannot see one word of what it was doing.
//!
//! # Why this is not the whole file
//!
//! #910 deferred a preview with a reason that is still half true:
//! *"the median transcript is 178 KB and the largest on this machine is
//! 76 MB, and rendering that in the webview is how you hang the app"*.
//! Re-measured here over the 1,502 real session transcripts:
//!
//! ```text
//! median   183,237 bytes (179 KB)
//! p90          464 KB
//! p99         11.4 MB
//! max     76,740,099 bytes   (one file, 8.4% of the 916 MB corpus)
//! over  1 MB    39 files (2.6%)
//! over 10 MB    16 files (1.1%)
//! ```
//!
//! The hazard is real and the remedy is the byte cap #910's own design
//! already specified. [`TAIL_BYTES`] is 256 KB, which returns the whole
//! conversation for the median session and a genuine tail for the 39
//! large ones -- so the cap is never the common case, and when it does
//! bind, [`Preview::truncated`] says so. A pane that silently showed a
//! tail would be the #846 defect in its purest form: the reader cannot
//! tell a short conversation from a truncated one.
//!
//! 256 KB rather than more because this crosses the pairing transport to
//! the phone on every selection, and 256 KB of JSONL reduces to far less
//! once the machinery records are dropped -- see below. It is also what
//! `transcript.rs`'s own `TAIL_BYTES_RETRY` already reads 1,502 times in
//! 0.35 s, so the machinery and its cost are both established.
//!
//! # An allowlist of record types, not a denylist
//!
//! Sixteen record types exist. Measured over 19,725 records sampled from
//! 60 files:
//!
//! ```text
//!   6950  assistant           862  last-prompt         138  file-history-delta
//!   4050  user                831  ai-title             86  file-history-snapshot
//!   3099  attachment          662  mode                 85  relocated
//!                             662  permission-mode      85  worktree-state
//!                             634  pr-link               4  cost-state
//!                             628  queue-operation
//!                             493  atis-latch
//!                             456  system
//! ```
//!
//! `assistant` and `user` are 55.8% of records and carry the conversation.
//! The other fourteen are bookkeeping, and a reader that rendered them
//! would show the user a wall of internal state.
//!
//! It is an ALLOWLIST because Claude Code owns this format and changes it
//! -- `liveness.rs`'s module docs already anticipate *"a release changing
//! it"*. An allowlist degrades to showing less; a denylist degrades to
//! showing a user the internals of a record type nobody has seen yet.
//!
//! # Content is a block array, not a string
//!
//! Measured over the same sample: of 1,586 `assistant`/`user` messages,
//! 1,500 carry `content` as a LIST and 86 as a bare string. The blocks:
//!
//! ```text
//! tool_use 510   tool_result 509   text 286   thinking 195
//! ```
//!
//! So a renderer that assumed a string would show nothing for 95% of
//! messages. [`Block`] carries each kind with its own shape, and the
//! non-text kinds are reported as what they are rather than flattened
//! into prose -- a `tool_use` summarised as "Read" tells the reader what
//! the session was doing, and its full arguments do not.
//!
//! # Read-only
//!
//! `mod.rs` lists exactly two write exceptions under `~/.claude` and says
//! *"Nothing else in here writes to `~/.claude` at all."* A reader adds
//! no exception.
