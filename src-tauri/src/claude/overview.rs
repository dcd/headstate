//! Aggregates for the Claude Code overview page (#921, epic #910).
//!
//! One question decides what is in this file and what is not: *does this
//! help me see what is going on, or resurrect something?* #921 lists five
//! candidates and asks for a cut rather than all five, and the cut below
//! is argued from measurements on the real corpus rather than from taste.
//!
//! # What the real corpus says, and it reframes the feature
//!
//! Measured by `tests::real_corpus_overview` on the development machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! sessions                  1461
//! live right now               3
//! cwd still exists           248      <- 17%
//! cwd gone                  1213      <- 83%
//! resumable (not live, cwd exists)   246
//!   ... last active within 7 days     126
//! distinct working directories       665
//! distinct claude versions            37
//! days with any activity              41
//! ```
//!
//! So the population is overwhelmingly ARCHAEOLOGY: 83% of sessions ran
//! in a directory that no longer exists, almost all of them deleted agent
//! worktrees. The overview's job is to find the 17% that is still live
//! work, and everything here is shaped by that ratio.
//!
//! # The correction to #921, and it is the important one
//!
//! #921 proposes that the single most valuable number is "how many
//! sessions are resurrection candidates -- dead pid, no clean end", and
//! calls that the feature's whole reason to exist. The premise is right
//! and the PREDICATE is wrong, measurably:
//!
//! **"dead pid, no `SessionEnd`" matches zero sessions on this machine,
//! and will keep matching almost none.**
//!
//! A pid reaches `claude_run` only from the `SessionStart` hook (#912,
//! #913). Every one of the 1,461 sessions here was imported from a
//! transcript (#914), and a transcript import is forbidden from writing
//! `claude_run` at all -- `store.rs` says why, and migration 11 declares
//! `claude_run.pid NOT NULL` precisely so an unobserved process cannot be
//! recorded as an observed one. So every session has zero runs, no pid
//! was ever recorded, and a "dead pid" filter selects nothing.
//!
//! That is not a transient state of an unfinished epic either. Sessions
//! that ran BEFORE the hook was installed can never acquire a pid
//! retroactively, and that is the entire history on any machine that
//! adopts Headstate after using Claude Code -- which is the normal case.
//!
//! The predicate that actually selects the actionable set is
//! **not running, and its directory still exists**:
//!
//! | predicate | matches here | what it means |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | dead pid, no `SessionEnd` | **0** | needs a pid we never recorded |
//! | not running + cwd exists | **246** | resumable INTO the tree it came from |
//! | not running + cwd gone | 1212 | resumable, but landing anywhere |
//!
//! 246 is the number worth putting at the top of a page, because it is
//! the count of sessions a user can act on today. `Counts::resumable`
//! is therefore that predicate, and [`Counts::orphaned_runs`] carries
//! #921's predicate alongside it rather than instead of it -- it becomes
//! the right answer once the hook is installed and starts observing
//! processes, and reporting it as a separate figure is how a reader can
//! tell "we never watched" from "we watched and it died".
//!
//! # Liveness is NOT derived here
//!
//! #917 owns that (`claude/liveness.rs`): a three-state derivation from
//! `(pid, pid_start_time)` against the process table, plus the live
//! registry under `~/.claude/sessions`. Re-deriving it here would give
//! the page two answers to one question, and the two would disagree the
//! first time either changed.
//!
//! They DID, until #1534. This page used to count from `live.rs`, a seam
//! written before #917 landed that answered only "which ids are
//! positively running". Everything outside that set was offered for
//! resumption -- including rows the session list called "could not
//! tell" because a terminal-launched session was running in their folder
//! (#1315). A Resume beside a session that may be alive starts a second
//! copy of it.
//!
//! So the page now counts from the session list ITSELF: [`report`] runs
//! [`super::sessions::list_with`] and reads each row's verdict off it, the
//! way the phone's digest does. The per-row answer here is the list's
//! answer by construction, not by two derivations agreeing, and `live.rs`
//! is gone. Everything else is SQL over `claude_session` / `claude_run`.
//! There is no process probe in this file.
//!
//! # Absent is not zero, and a chart is the worst place to break it
//!
//! [`Overview`] is returned whole or not at all: a failed query is an
//! `Err` the view renders as "could not tell", never a struct of zeros.
//! That matters more here than almost anywhere else in the app, because
//! a bar chart of zeros does not LOOK absent -- a flat line reads as a
//! measured quiet week. A tile showing "0 resumable" on a machine with
//! 246 of them is a confidently wrong answer, and #846 is the same bug
//! one view over: a `= []` default made a REJECTED scan read as "no
//! CLAUDE.md files in this repository".
//!
//! So the two counts that can be partially unknown carry their unknowns
//! as data -- [`Counts::cwd_unknown`] is sessions whose directory could
//! not be checked, and it is neither "exists" nor "gone".
