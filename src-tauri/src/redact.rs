//! Patterns for the things that must never reach the diagnostic log.
//!
//! The log exists to be sent. `lib.rs:190-218` describes the workflow it
//! was built for -- "turn the log on, reproduce the problem, send the
//! file" -- and that is the whole reason this module exists. A user who
//! attaches the log to an issue is acting on what Settings told them it
//! contains, so anything Settings does not warn about must not be in it.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT redacted: the pull-request action lines
//! (`commands.rs:178` and its siblings). Those name a repository and a
//! number on purpose -- README advertises them as an audit trail of
//! every write the app makes, and redacting them would destroy a
//! documented feature to satisfy a sentence of copy. The copy is what
//! was wrong. It now says what these lines hold.
//!
//! This mirrors `src/lib/report.ts`'s `SCRUB` table, which had the right
//! patterns on the wrong side of the boundary: it guarded the issue
//! report body while the log itself was written unredacted.
//! `mirroredConstants.test.ts` asserts the two tables still agree, for
//! the reason #850 records -- five constant pairs whose comments claimed
//! agreement, none of which read the other side, one already drifted.
