    // stay authoritative.
    //
    // This table does not accumulate anything. It memoises an ANSWER
    // GitHub already gave, keyed by the question, and GitHub's `is:merged`

    // # Why caching is correct here and not merely fast

    // A leaderboard over a CLOSED time window cannot change: the PRs
    // merged in August 2026 are fixed once August is over. So the cache
    // is not a staleness trade, it is the recognition that recomputing a
    // constant is waste -- and the waste is large, because recomputing
    // means the probe rounds and slice fetches of `github::stats::fetch`,
    // which cost requests against a 5,000/hour budget.
    //
    // `window_end` is what makes that safe, and it is why the row carries
    // the window rather than only a key: a caller can tell an answer about
    // a closed window (reusable forever) from one about a window that
    // includes today (reusable only briefly). The decision lives in
    // `store::stats`, not here, but the column it needs is here.

    // # Why TWO tables when a session has one id

    // Measured, not assumed: `session_id` SURVIVES A RESUME. Starting a
    // session, `/exit`, then `claude --resume <id>` reports the same
    // `session_id` with `source: "resume"` -- and `--continue` does too --

    //     startup  sid c8518222  ppid 34164
    //     resume   sid c8518222  ppid 38366
    //     resume   sid c8518222  ppid 44163
    //     startup  sid 1db49024  ppid 46351   <- a fresh session mints a new id
    //
    // So there is no parent/child session to model, and the id is a stable
    // primary key. But a single table would have to overwrite `pid` on every
    // resume, losing the history of how many times a session was revived and
    // when -- which is most of what the overview page (#921) is for. The pid
    // belongs to a RUN, not to the session.
    //
    // # Why there is no `status` or `is_running` column, deliberately
    //
    // Liveness is DERIVED at read time and never stored. The reason is the
    // whole premise of this feature: `SessionEnd` does not fire on SIGKILL,
    // a closed terminal, a crash, or an OS reap -- only on `/exit`, Ctrl+D
    // and clean completion. So a stored flag would say "running" forever
    // for precisely the sessions the user wants to resurrect, with nothing
    // to correct it.
    //
    // That is the `is_some_and` fail-open of #841 in another costume: a
    // value we could not refresh, presented as a fact. `caches/mod.rs:550`
    // states the house rule -- an idle time we could not read is not
    // evidence that anything is disposable.
    //
    // `schema_has_no_claude_status_column` asserts the absence, because a
    // well-meaning later change would otherwise add one for speed.

    // # Why `pid_start_time` rides alongside `pid`
    //
    // A pid alone is a fail-open: pids are recycled, so a long-dead
    // session whose number has been reissued would read as running. Pairing
    // the pid with the process start time is the same defence
    // `health/runaway.rs` already uses for its `(pid, start_time)` identity,
    // and for the same reason.

    // NULLABLE on purpose. It comes from `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`'s

    // `transcript.rs` states the case for no incremental machinery, and
    // it is right FOR ITSELF: its reader is bounded at 40 head records
    // and a 16 KB tail, so a full rescan is 200-250 ms and a cache would
    // cost more than it saves.
    //
    // This scan cannot be bounded that way. A plugin call can appear at
    // any point in a transcript, so answering "how often was this
    // plugin called" needs the whole body of every file. MEASURED on the
    // real corpus: 2,474 files, 1.7 GB, **26 s** cold. That is not a page
    // load, and it is two orders of magnitude away from the read the
    // no-cache argument was made about. `usage.rs` draws the same line
    // for the same reason -- "affordable per session detail and still
    // must never join the startup scan".
    //
    // So the file-level result is cached and keyed on what makes it
    // stale.
    //
    // # Why mtime and size, and what they are NOT
    //
    // `crash.rs` rejects mtime as a claim about when something happened,
    // and that rejection stands: nothing here stores mtime as a time. It
    // is a CHANGE KEY -- "is this file the one we read?" -- and `size`
    // rides with it because a transcript is append-only in practice, so
    // a changed size is the cheap positive signal and mtime catches a
    // rewrite that happened to land on the same length.
    //
    // A false HIT would silently freeze a plugin's count. A false MISS
    // costs one re-read of one file. The pair is chosen so the cheap
    // error is the one we make.
    //
    // # Why per file and not per plugin
    //
    // The unit of invalidation is the file: it is what changes, and what
    // we can tell has changed without reading it. Summing to per-plugin
    // totals is a GROUP BY over a few thousand rows, which is free, and
    // storing the totals instead would mean re-deriving them from
    // scratch on any single file's change -- the thing this exists to
    // avoid.
    //
    // `path` is the primary key rather than a session id because a
    // subagent transcript has no session row (migration 11 never sees
    // one) and, as `plugins::usage_files` measures, most plugin calls
    // happen inside one. Keying on `session_id` would drop 80% of
    // `playwright`'s calls on the floor.
    //
    // `calls` is a JSON object of `{plugin: {kind: n}}` plus the
    // failures and last-called stamp, because the alternative -- a row
    // per (file, plugin, kind) -- is a schema that has to be re-derived
    // and re-inserted wholesale whenever one file changes, for a value

    //
    // - A 30-day board and a 90-day board overlapping by 30 days store the
    //   same pull requests twice, under two keys, and NEITHER helps the
    //   other.
    // - Changing the day-range selector discards 100% of the accumulated
    //   work, because the key it was filed under no longer matches.
    // - There is no way to ask *"do we hold 2026-08-14 for org:X?"* --
    //   only *"do we hold the 30-day window ending yesterday?"*. So a
    //   fetch cannot subtract what is stored from what it is about to
    //   request, which is #1092's finding: `pr_history::count` was built
    //   so "completeness is a COUNT question" and had zero production
    //   callers, because the question it answers is the wrong one.
    //
    // #1092 also records that the old key breaks at UTC midnight: the
    // window is `now - N days`, so when the date rolls, `load` matches
    // nothing and every banked row becomes unreachable. That is the same
    // defect seen from a different angle, and re-keying fixes both.
    //
    // Eventual consistency requires the durable unit to be **a slice, not
    // a question**. The columns are RENAMED rather than reused so the new
    // meaning cannot be mistaken for the old: a `slice_from` that still
    // held a window would be a silent lie, where a missing `window_start`
    // is a compile error.
    //
    // # Why the existing rows are DROPPED rather than re-keyed
    //
    // They cannot be re-keyed. A row carries no `merged_at` -- the column
    // did not exist -- so there is no way to learn which day inside the
    // window it belongs to, and filing it under the whole window would
    // reintroduce exactly the ambiguity being removed. Keeping them under
    // a legacy interpretation means two meanings for one column, which is
    // strictly worse than re-fetching.
    //
    // The cost is measured and trivial. `pr_history`'s own module records
    // ~1 point per 250 pull requests, so the worst realistic corpus (the
    // reporter's 2,942) is **~12 points to re-fetch -- 0.27% of one
    // usable hour**. A permanently ambiguous key is the worse trade by a
    // wide margin.
    //
    // `stats_cache` is deliberately NOT dropped: its payloads are opaque
    // JSON, an unparseable one already degrades to a re-fetch, and
    // #1004's `accumulated` fields are optional for exactly this reason.
    //
    // # `merged_at` is now on the row
    //
    // It is what attributes a pull request to a DAY, which is what makes
    // day-level coverage answerable ("34 of 90 days measured") and what
    // lets a row retrieved by one slice be counted toward another. Stored
    // as the `YYYY-MM-DD` date rather than the full timestamp: the search
    // grammar's finest unit is a day, so the time of day is precision the
    // ledger cannot use and could not verify.
    //
    // Despite the name it holds whichever date the MEASURE is about --
    // `mergedAt` for `Measure::Merged`, `createdAt` for `Measure::Opened`
    // -- because that is the date the slice's own qualifier ranged over.
    // The measure is already in `scope_key` (`StatsQuery::cache_key`
    // includes it, checked: the key is `{merged|opened}|{who}|{scope}`),
    // so two measures never share a row.
    //
    // # `pr_slice`: the ledger, and the three-way question it answers
    //
    // The piece that did not exist. A reader asks one question -- "what do
    // we hold for this range?" -- and there are THREE answers, not two:
    //
    // | The question | The answer |
    // |---|---|
    // | "we hold this range complete" | a row with `state='complete'` |
    // | "we asked and GitHub could not" | `state='refused'`/`'irreducible'` |
    // | **"we have never asked"** | **no row at all** |
    //
    // That last line is load-bearing and is this feature's most likely
    // place to ship a defect. A day with no `pr_slice` row is
    // **uncovered**, never a measured zero. The root `CLAUDE.md` states
    // the rule -- absent is not zero -- and #846 is the time this repo
    // shipped it. A chart invites the eye to read shape, so rendering an
    // unasked day as a zero is the most legible possible lie.
    //
    // `state` has **no `pending` value**, deliberately. In-flight is
    // PROCESS state, not durable state: a crash mid-tick would leave a row
    // stuck in `pending` forever with nothing to move it out, which is
    // #1042's trap exactly ("Pending and Unknown are different states";
    // a column skeletoned forever because nothing advanced it). A slice
    // being worked on right now simply has no row yet, and is therefore
    // uncovered -- which is true, and self-correcting.
    //
    // `issue_count` is GitHub's own `issueCount` for the range, which the
    // 1,000-result cap does NOT limit (`slice.rs`: the cap limits
    // retrieval, not counting). So the ledger's `SUM(issue_count)` is an
    // exact denominator for the days it covers, and `retrieved` against it
    // is what makes a shortfall detectable rather than invisible.
    //
    // # `pr_backfill_scope`: what the worker is allowed to walk
    //
    // A worker with no record of which scopes matter would either walk
    // everything the token can see or nothing at all. This records the
    // scopes a user has actually OPENED, so background spend follows
    // demonstrated interest. `horizon_days` bounds how far back each one
