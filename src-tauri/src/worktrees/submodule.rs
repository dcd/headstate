//! Which of a worktree's dirty lines are submodules.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! #1138 proposed this as a safety gate: a worktree with a dirty
//! submodule "is reported as clean and safe", so removing it would lose
//! uncommitted submodule work silently. That was checked against real
//! git before building, and it does not happen. `git status --porcelain`
//! in the PARENT reports all three submodule states as one ` M <path>`
//! line:
//!
//! | done inside the submodule | parent's porcelain line |
//! |---|---|
//! | modified a tracked file | ` M vendor/sub` |
//! | added an untracked file | ` M vendor/sub` |
//! | committed, so it is ahead | ` M vendor/sub` |
//!
//! `scan.rs` counts that line, so [`super::model::Safety::Dirty`]
//! already wins and plain Remove already declines. The gate works.
//!
//! What is real is the rest of it: that line is indistinguishable from
//! an edited file. The user is told "1 uncommitted file" when the truth
//! is "a submodule has work in it", and those have different remedies --
//! one is `git add`, the other is a commit and push inside a different
//! repository that the parent only records a pointer to.
//!
//! So this DISAMBIGUATES a count the user already sees. It is
//! deliberately not a second gate over the same fact, which would be a
//! refusal with two reasons and no new protection.
//!
//! # `git submodule status` is the wrong command, measured
//!
//! The issue named it. Its `+` flag means the submodule is at a
//! DIFFERENT COMMIT, not that it has uncommitted work:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ echo x > vendor/sub/newfile && git submodule status
//!  c2ca683... vendor/sub (heads/main)     # leading SPACE -- "in sync"
//! ```
//!
//! A `dirty` count built from that flag would have read 0 for exactly
//! the case this is about. So dirt is read with `git status --porcelain`
//! inside each submodule, which is the same question asked the same way
//! the parent's own dirt is asked.
//!
//! # The `.gitmodules` gate, and why it is the whole design
//!
//! Anything submodule-shaped costs a subprocess, and `git submodule`
//! is a shell script that costs about the same whether or not there is
//! anything to report. Measured on this machine:
//!
//! | command | repo with 1 submodule | repo with none |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `git submodule status --recursive` | 90 ms | 65 ms |
//! | `git status --porcelain` (for scale) | -- | 10 ms |
//! | `stat(".gitmodules")` | -- | 0.0008 ms |
//!
//! Exactly 1 of the 18 repositories checked out here has a
//! `.gitmodules`. Across ~295 worktrees, asking unconditionally is
//! roughly 19 seconds of subprocess time per scan to report nothing.
//!
//! [`has_submodules`] is a `stat` 80,000 times cheaper than the command
//! it guards, and it is exact rather than heuristic: git records
//! submodules in `.gitmodules`, so a repository without one has none.
