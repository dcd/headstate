//! GitHub's record of a merged pull request, as a POSITIVE merge signal
//! for the worktree view (#1440).
//!
//! # Why the offline checks are not enough
//!
//! `scan::merged_into` looks for a branch's CONTENT on the default
//! branch. Ancestry misses every squash merge, so it falls through to two
//! squash signals, and both decay as the default branch moves on:
//!
//! - the aggregate patch-id hashes the diff WITH context lines, so a
//!   neighbouring change landing first gives the squash commit different
//!   context and a different id (measured: 0 of 3 matched);
//! - `content_landed` needs every file the branch touched to still read
//!   the way the branch left it, which any later edit to one of those
//!   files breaks (measured: 0/2, 9/18 and 6/18 files identical).
//!
//! So on an active repository a squash-merged branch stops reading as
//! merged within days, and the rows that most need reclaiming are the
//! ones that lose the label. GitHub's record of the merge does not decay.
//!
//! # The scan stays offline
//!
//! Nothing here runs inside `scan::classify`. That pass is offline by
//! design -- a per-worktree network call was rejected because it hangs on
//! an unreachable remote -- and this module does not reopen that. The
//! lookup is ONE batched GraphQL request per repository per
//! [`crate::github::query::MERGED_HEADS_CHUNK`] branch names, run AFTER
//! the offline verdicts exist, under a deadline and the process budget.
//!
//! # The rule is strict, and only ever upgrades
//!
//! [`qualifying_pr`] is the whole rule, and every part of it is a refusal
//! by default:
//!
//! - only a row the offline pass called `Unmerged` or `Unpushed` is a
//!   candidate ([`upgradeable`]); dirty, in-progress and locked rows are
//!   decided before either of those and are never asked about;
//! - the pull request must be `MERGED` (the query filters to it) and its
//!   base must be the repository's default branch as GitHub names it;
//! - the worktree's HEAD must BE the PR's `headRefOid`, or be an ancestor
//!   of it: the PR carried every commit the worktree has. A local commit
//!   past the PR's head is work GitHub never saw, and does not qualify.
//!
//! And every failure -- not signed in, no GitHub remote, budget reserved,
//! timed out, refused, repository missing -- leaves the offline verdict
//! exactly as it was. The row then says what the offline pass found,
//! never that GitHub said "not merged": we did not ask is not they did
//! not answer (#1050).
