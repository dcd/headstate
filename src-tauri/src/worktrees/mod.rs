//! Local git worktree discovery.
//!
//! Agents create worktrees; pull requests merge; the worktrees stay. On
//! this machine that is 202 worktrees across 6 repositories in a `~/code`
//! totalling 270 GB, which is how a disk fills up silently.
//!
//! Discovery asks GIT rather than scanning for `.git` files: git owns the
//! truth about which worktrees exist, so there is no orphan-guessing and
//! no false positives from a stale directory.
//!
//! Nothing here talks to GitHub. It is local disk work and deliberately
//! runs off the poll loop.
