/// a body. The decision is made on a TYPED value at the point the
/// condition is first known -- `octocrab::Error::GitHub`'s `status_code`
/// is an `http::StatusCode`, and the arm tests it for 401. Nothing reads
/// English to reach that decision.
///
/// # Why a marker rather than a struct on the wire
///
/// Exactly `NOT_ASKED`'s reason, and established by measurement rather
/// than assumed: #1230's tier-2 work read all three transports and
/// found that the `{kind, message}` object #1202 put on the remote wire
/// reaches the webview on NEITHER. The desktop's `poll-error` is a
/// Tauri event carrying a bare `String`; the phone's `remote_call` is
/// `Result<Value, String>`, and the companion's proxy reads `message`
/// and drops `kind` one process early. A marker embedded in the prose
/// is the only classification this codebase has that crosses, which is
/// why `NOT_ASKED` was never superseded.
///
/// The kind is still the type: [`crate::remote::error_kind::ErrorKind`]
/// gains `ExpiredToken`, asserted against the TypeScript union in both
/// directions by `mirroredConstants.test.ts`. This constant is only its
/// transport.
///
/// # Why this is not the old regex moved across the boundary
///
/// A marker is a fixed string this crate emits and matches as a prefix
/// against its own constant. The regex it replaces --
/// `/401|unauthorized|bad credentials/i` run over the banner's prose in
/// `AuthGate.tsx` -- was English matched against a pattern that hoped
/// GitHub kept wording things the same way, and it was already wrong:
/// octocrab's `Display` for `Error::GitHub` is the bare word "GitHub",
/// so a real HTTP 401 reached the banner as "GitHub request failed:
/// GitHub" and the regex did not match it. The remedy never appeared
/// for the case it was written for; it fired only when GitHub happened
/// to put "Bad credentials" in a GraphQL body. Deciding on the status
/// code fixes that as a consequence of typing it, which is the argument
/// for typing it.
///

///

/// stripped before display, so the sentence the user reads is
/// unchanged. Only how the remedy is DECIDED changed.

/// finer and its request count is driven by the DAY COUNT rather than by how
/// near the cap the window is. The worst case is one slice per day, which is
/// the floor the date grammar imposes -- GitHub has no sub-day range -- and
/// it is reached by any scope busy enough to exceed a 50-node page every day.
///
/// So the bound is computed from the two fan-outs rather than guessed:
///
/// - **Probes.** One request per `query::ALIAS_CHUNK` slices per round, and
///   at most `MAX_PROBE_ROUNDS` rounds before every slice is a single day.
/// - **Detail.** One request per `board::BOARD_ALIAS_CHUNK` slices.
/// - **Plus one** for the `fetch_viewer` call the split needs.
///
/// I found the old arithmetic wrong by checking it against this: `days/5 + 8`
/// gives 14 for a 30-day window whose worst case is ~15 requests, and 26 for
/// a 90-day window whose worst case is ~45. Under-projecting is the dangerous
/// direction, because the check exists precisely to stop a load starting that
/// then runs the budget below `RESERVE` and starves the poll loop -- the one
/// part of the app with a standing obligation.
///
/// For reference, the MEASURED figure on a real 30-day org window (569 merged

/// disagree -- a Mine figure that does not match the viewer's own entry on
/// the leaderboard beside it is the kind of contradiction a reader cannot
/// resolve and will not trust.
///
/// It is also why `subject` is not a parameter here. A board asks about
/// EVERYONE; `scope.rs` has a test named for the mistake of constraining
/// one to a single author, which renders a board with one name on it. The
/// viewer's login is resolved server-side so the split can be made, and a
/// member row's subject is applied by the UI to that same board rather than
/// by re-querying.
///
/// # Cost, and why this one is gated
///
/// Unlike `stats_tree`, this is the expensive click. The probe rounds plus
/// one detail request per `board::BOARD_ALIAS_CHUNK` slices, each measured
/// at 1 point, so the projection below is the same shape `stats_count`
/// uses. `Budget::permits` refuses before spending, because the thing being
/// protected is the poll loop's standing obligation and a leaderboard is
/// something the user asked for once.
///
/// # Cached for a CLOSED window, since #836
///
/// It was not, and the reason recorded here was scope: "a board is not a
/// number… caching it properly needs a migration of its own". #836 is that
/// follow-up, and no migration turned out to be needed -- migration 10's
/// `payload` is already an opaque JSON blob and `complete` already carries
/// partiality, so the only genuine blocker was the key. A board has no
/// subject (it is about everyone), so `StatsQuery::cache_key` would have
/// given it the same string as the scope's whole-population COUNT;
/// `store::stats::Kind` is the discriminator that fixes it.
///
/// The asymmetry #836 objected to was that the cache covered the CHEAPEST
/// query and skipped this one. `board_projection` bounds a 90-day board at
/// ~45 points against `stats_count`'s ~26, and the node fetching is
/// "seconds over a busy org" -- so a cold start was re-spending the full
/// board cost for a leaderboard over a month that had already ended.
///
/// Two things it is careful NOT to do, both from #836's acceptance list:
///
/// - **An open window is not cached as if final.** `store::stats::get`
///   already bounds an open window to `OPEN_WINDOW_TTL_SECS`, so the write
///   is safe either way; it is still worth saying that the window here
///   ends YESTERDAY (`parse_scope_request`), which is what makes most
///   requests land on a closed window at all.
/// - **A partial board is stored WITH its partiality.** `board.complete`
///   goes into the `complete` column, so a read-back cannot launder a
///   capped roster into a confident one.
///
/// The roster question the old comment raised -- whether a membership
/// change should invalidate a closed window's board -- answers itself:
/// the board is built from the pull requests merged in the window, not
/// from a roster, so who is in the org TODAY cannot change who merged
/// something in August. (That is not true of the reviews-GIVEN board,
/// which takes its logins as an argument; `stats_reviewers` is not cached

/// it. Both boards ship, labelled for what each measures.
///
/// The two genuinely name DIFFERENT people on this account's own data
/// (MEASURED live 2026-09-11): a `reviewed-by:<viewer>` search over an org
/// window returned two pull requests, both AUTHORED BY SOMEONE ELSE and each
/// carrying `reviews { totalCount } == 1`. So the same two pull requests
/// credit the AUTHOR on the received board and the REVIEWER on the given one
/// -- different names, same rows of data.
///
/// # Why the LOGINS are an argument
///
/// The roster is already on screen. `stats_tree` enumerated it for the
/// sidebar at 2 points (#825), and the caller holds `org.members` for the
/// scope the user clicked -- so asking GitHub for it a second time here
/// would spend a request to re-derive a list the frontend already has, and
/// could disagree with the Members rows beside the board if the two reads
/// straddled a roster change.
///
/// The honest consequence, which the UI states rather than this command
/// hiding: this board covers the people in the list, NOT everyone who
/// reviewed. A reviewer from outside the org -- an outside collaborator, a
/// bot -- is absent, because nothing enumerated them. That is a bounded and
/// explainable gap; the alternative, enumerating reviewers from the PR nodes
/// themselves, cannot be done at all (see above) and enumerating them from
/// the org roster is exactly what this does.
///
/// # Cost
///
/// ONE request per `ALIAS_CHUNK` logins, each measured at 1 point: 4
/// reviewer aliases cost 1 at 0.84-1.04s, 36 cost 1 at 3.62-4.15s (live API,
/// 2026-09-11, `org:FNX-Labs`; the table is in `query::reviewer_query`). So
