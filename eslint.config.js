  // against a 4 GB heap with three siblings present, versus 316 files and
  // 2.16 GB with this entry. The warnings were wrong too: 60 reported,
  // only 15 of them about this checkout.
  //
  // CI is unaffected either way -- it checks out fresh and has no
  // `.worktrees` -- which is why the failure survived: the one place that
  // would have reported it could not see it. #983
