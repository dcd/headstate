/// The three freshness states get three DIFFERENT sentences, and the
/// differences are the point (#1042, #846):
///
/// - `"fresh"` is the only one allowed to say the report is current, and
///   it distinguishes a run that just happened from a stored report
///   whose fingerprint was recomputed in full and matched. Both read as
///   current because both mean every tracked input was read.
/// - `"cached"` says it came from the store. `stale` splits it: an
///   unchanged cached report is current in substance, a stale one is
///   explicitly not, and `refreshing` turns the stale phrasing into the
///   composed "and a new one is running" -- the state the backend
///   deliberately cannot claim for itself.
/// - `"unverified"` says currency is UNKNOWN and gives the producer's
///   own reason. It is never phrased as fresh-with-a-caveat: a matching
///   fingerprint here proves nothing because it omitted something both
///   times, so the tone is `"unknown"` and the word "current" does not
///   appear in it at all.
///
/// `refreshing` is true while a fresh run is in flight: the automatic one
/// behind a stale cached report, or a Re-check over any state (#1343).
/// It is honoured wherever it is passed, so no state silently drops the
/// fact that a run is going.
