/// it was a scan. Grouping answers the question the list is actually
/// asked -- "what did this session produce, and where" -- in one read.
///
/// # Ascending within a group, on purpose
///
/// Not newest-first, which is this app's default everywhere else. Within
/// ONE session the numbers were issued in roughly the order the work
/// happened, so ascending reads as the sequence of that session's work.
/// Descending would present the same list back-to-front against the
/// transcript beside it.
///
/// # The group order is alphabetical, and it is chosen rather than left
///
/// Repository name, case-insensitively, with the raw name as the
/// tiebreak so two repos differing only in case still have one settled
/// order. The alternative -- ordering groups by the smallest PR number,
/// or by first appearance -- would make the list re-order itself as new
/// PRs land, which is the thing that made the flat list hard to read.
/// Alphabetical is stable under any addition.

/// the same session would group differently for two users, and the
/// comparison here is over `owner/repo` slugs that are ASCII by GitHub's
/// own rules.
