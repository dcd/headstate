/// The restart list, rendered as the text a user saves before a reboot
/// (#1071).
///
/// # Why this is a pure function in `lib/` and not JSX
///
/// It is the thing the feature actually produces. A component that built
/// the string inline could only be tested through the DOM, and the four
/// properties that matter here -- a `Gone` directory never emits a `cd`,
/// a metacharacter-bearing id stays quoted, a shortfall is stated, an
/// `Unknown` session is present -- are properties of the TEXT. Testing
/// them through a render would test the rendering instead.
///
/// # The shape, and why every part of it is load-bearing
///
/// ```text
/// # Claude Code sessions to restart
/// # Generated 2026-09-15T09:41:02.000Z — 3 sessions (2 running, 1 could not be checked)
///
/// cd '/Users/x/repo' && claude --resume 'abc-123'
///
/// # The directory this session ran in is gone (/tmp/old), so this will
/// # resume in whatever directory you run it from.
/// claude --resume 'def-456'
/// ```
///
/// - **A `#` header with the time and the count.** The file outlives the
///   machine state it describes; a list with no timestamp is one the user
///   cannot tell from a stale one they saved last month.
/// - **The caveat ABOVE its line, as a `#` comment.** Not beside it and
///   not in a footnote: a bare `claude --resume` resumes in whatever
///   directory the shell happens to be in, and the user is pasting these
///   blind. Above means they read it before the line they are about to
///   run.
/// - **Shell comments, so the whole file is pasteable.** Every
///   non-command line starts with `#`, which means a user who selects the
///   lot and pastes it gets the commands and not syntax errors.
///
/// The commands themselves are NOT built here. They arrive built, from
/// `claude::sessions::resume_command`, which quotes both halves and
/// handles four cwd states -- see `ClaudeRestartEntry`.

/// The header's first line. Also what the test matches on, so a change
/// here is a change both sides see.
