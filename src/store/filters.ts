  //
  // The v5.13.0 rebuild is the reason: the page answers "how am I doing"
  // and "how is my team doing" across every organisation and member, not
  // just this machine's checkouts. That is a thing someone opens the app
  // TO SEE, so it leads rather than sitting ninth of ten.
  //
  // This list's order is only cosmetic -- `View` is derived from it and

  // It used to say the two lists were kept in the same order deliberately,
  // "so a reader comparing them should not have to wonder which one the
  // user sees". That stopped being true in #1017: `ViewSwitcher`'s `VIEWS`
  // is grouped now, and the menu renders group by group, so the order a
  // user sees is `GROUPS` first and position within a group second. The
  // two lists still happen to read alike, but only by coincidence, and a
  // comment claiming otherwise is one a reader would rely on.
  //
  // What IS still true, and is the part worth keeping: `VIEWS` is what
  // the menu renders and this list only derives the type. When they

/// SIGKILL, which is what makes that inference sound -- and `liveness.rs`
/// draws it. But the DISTINCTION crosses the wire only inside
/// `liveness.why`, as the sentence "…so this session ended without shutting
/// down". There is no flag.

/// Rust. That is a second description of a rule that already has one, in a
/// language whose compiler cannot see the first -- and the failure is
/// silent and total: a reworded sentence leaves the chip matching zero rows
/// while every test that mocks its own fixtures stays green. `ClaudeCodePage`
/// makes exactly this argument about stating the ordering rule once, and
/// `notify.rs` makes it about thresholds.
///
/// `"ended"` is the honest structured neighbour: `liveness.state === "dead"`,
/// which is every session that has finished, crash or clean. It is a real
/// narrowing of 1,474 rows and it promises only what it can check. A
