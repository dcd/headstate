/// reason to exist.
///
/// What must be hidden is narrower: the two `claude_reveal_path` buttons.
/// `surfaceGuard.test.ts` already proves that wrapper is `Class::Local`
/// and that the phone may not call it -- but that is a check on the
/// ALLOWLIST, not on what gets rendered. A page that renders a button the
/// allowlist refuses still ships a control that can only fail, and the
/// allowlist test passes the whole time. This file is the other half: it
/// renders the page as the phone build and asserts on the DOM.
///
/// Run under the mobile build by mocking `@/lib/target`. `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`
/// is a Vite `define` that folds to a literal, so there is no environment
/// variable to set at test time -- see `lib/target.ts`.
///
/// And at a PHONE VIEWPORT, as of #939, which is a second thing and now a
/// necessary one. `IS_MOBILE_BUILD` says which build this is;
/// `useIsMobile()` says whether the narrow LAYOUT is on, and jsdom has no
/// `matchMedia`, so every test in this file previously read as desktop
/// width while claiming to be the phone. That was harmless while both
/// widths drew the same single component. It is not harmless now: #939
/// moved the session list into `ClaudeCodeSidebar` on the desktop and left
/// `ClaudeCodePage` mounting it itself on the phone, so the two widths
/// render different trees and only the narrow one is this file's subject.
