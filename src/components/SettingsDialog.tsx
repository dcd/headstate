          Only the content pane scrolls.

          Width: `max-w-lg` was 32rem, chosen when this was one column.
          The topic menu then took 9rem of it and left ~20rem for
          controls, which squeezed every row -- the poll-interval label
          and its select, the cleanup granularity rows. `max-w-3xl`
          gives the content pane roughly the width it had before the
          menu existed.

          Height: the dialog had a max but no fixed height, so it sized
          to whichever topic was showing and jumped on every switch --
          moving the window under the cursor, so the topic just clicked
          could end up somewhere else. `h-[32rem]` holds it still.

          Sizing to the tallest topic would also stop the jumping, but
          pads every short topic with dead space and changes again the
          moment a setting is added. A fixed frame does not. */}

          tailwind-merge keyed separately from a bare `max-w-*` and that
          won above 640px -- so the bare form came out NARROWER than the

          ~214px of content pane at 390px -- not enough for the `w-40`
          selects or the keyboard-shortcut grid inside it, and the

            Here rather than under Repositories because it is about what
            gets RECLAIMED, which is this section's subject -- and beside
            the automatic-cleanup block above because both answer "what is
            this app allowed to consider disposable".

            Outside the `cleanup?.enabled` gate deliberately: the
            threshold governs the Artifacts page's Stale badge and its
            checkboxes whether or not the unattended pass is on, so hiding
            it behind that switch would hide the number that labels rows a
            user is looking at right now.

            A SELECT, not a number field. `poll::stale_venv_days` clamps
            to 30..3650 and its comment says why the floor matters --
            "this number gates a delete once the opt-in above is on, so
            the floor is what stops a typo in Settings from making live
            work selectable". A free-text field would have to
            re-implement that clamp on the way in, and a field that
            silently rewrites 7 to 30 leaves the user believing a
            threshold the app does not have. The poll interval's
            `INTERVALS` is the same choice for the same reason. */}
