/// Content search over the transcript corpus (#1203, epic #1121).
///
/// The app has always held 1,482 transcripts and 0.83 GB of text and
/// indexed only metadata, so "find the session where I was debugging the
/// FSEvents thing" was a question it could not answer about data it
/// already had. This is the surface that answers it.
///
/// # This component's whole job is the empty state
///
/// Everything else here is a list. The part that is the ticket is what
/// this renders when nothing matched, because there are TWO reasons for
/// that and they must not produce the same sentence:
///
/// | backend verdict | what this renders |
/// |---|---|
/// | `matches` | the hits |
/// | `none` | "No matches" — licensed only because the WHOLE corpus was searched |
/// | `none_yet` | "No matches in the 340 of 1,482 sessions indexed so far" |
///
/// The third row is the feature. 6.0 removed that conflation from four
/// other surfaces (#846, #1042, #1044, #1152), and a search box is the
/// place a user is least likely to question an empty result: an empty
/// list reads as a settled fact about their history, not as a statement
/// about our bookkeeping.
///
/// The backend makes this hard to get wrong -- `verdict` is a tagged
/// union, so there is no possibly-empty array to render carelessly --
/// but the WORDING lives here, and `ClaudeTranscriptSearch.test.tsx`
/// asserts on the distinct strings rather than on which branch ran.
///
/// # Staleness is a fact about the index, not about the session
///
/// When coverage is short, the line says the index has not reached those
/// sessions yet. It deliberately does not say the sessions are empty or
/// missing: that would be a claim about the user's data, and it would be
/// false. This is a claim about ours, and it is true.
