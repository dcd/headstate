/// per-surface wording is different CLAIMS about different scans -- "Could
/// not scan for repositories." and "Could not scan for worktrees." and
/// "build output or virtualenvs" are not interchangeable, and a user told
/// only that a scan failed cannot tell whether a group is absent because it
/// failed or because there are none. Likewise `onRetry` is a handler rather
/// than one `refetch`, because `ArtifactSidebar` retries only what actually
/// failed: re-running a 26-second virtualenv scan that succeeded would throw
/// away a result the page is still rendering.
///
/// `tap-target` because a failed scan's retry is the only route out of a
/// failed scan, and at `text-xs` with no padding the link form was roughly a
/// 15px hit area against the 44px minimum `index.css` establishes.
