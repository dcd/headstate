/// The banner for a worktree scan that could not read everything (#951).
///
/// # The third answer
///
/// A scan has three outcomes, not two. "We have not looked yet", "we
/// looked and there is nothing", and "we looked and could not tell" are
/// three different claims with three different remedies, and this
/// component is the third one. Before #951 the walk had nowhere to put it:
/// `scan_dirs_fast` returned a bare `Vec<Repo>`, so a repository whose
/// worktree listing failed was simply absent and read as "not a
/// repository".
///
/// `RepoPickerSidebar`'s empty copy is why that mattered most --
/// "No repositories found in the scanned folders" is a DIAGNOSIS pointing
/// at the user's settings, so a failed scan sent someone to fix a
/// configuration that was never wrong. `emptyStateGuard.test.ts` names it
/// the worst copy of the six it audits, and gave it an `isError` arm that
/// could never fire because the command could not reject.
///
/// # Why this is not an error panel
///
/// `QueryError` blanks the list and offers a retry, which is right when
/// the whole query failed. This is the OTHER case: some of the scan
/// succeeded. The repositories that did read are real and worth showing --
/// the trade `ArtifactsPage` states -- so this sits ABOVE the list rather
/// than instead of it, and offers no retry: an unreadable path is
/// unreadable for a reason that a second identical walk will not change,
/// and #846's `retry: false` reasoning is about exactly this.
///
/// # Why the reasons are shown
///
/// A count alone ("3 paths could not be read") is unactionable. The Rust
/// side sends `<path>: <why>` per entry for the reason
/// `claude/transcript.rs` gives for a message over a boolean: git refusing
/// a repository owned by another uid, a permission wall, and git missing
/// from a GUI-launched app's PATH send the user to three different places,
/// and only the message distinguishes them.
