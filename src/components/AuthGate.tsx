  // and there is a cached list to show while it arrives.
  //
  // On `IS_MOBILE_BUILD`, not `useIsMobile()`: whether this app can

  // dismisses on every terminal state: an offline phone is about to
  // render a real screen -- the cached list -- and a fixed inset-0

  // away from its desk was an empty `#0d1117` window (#684).
  //
  // Letting the children through is not a guess that the desktop is
  // signed in. It is that the desktop's auth is unknowable from here
  // and NOT what the user needs told: `ConnectionBanner` already names
  // the desktop and when it was last seen, `StaleRibbon` already marks
  // the cached rows as a saved copy, and `useWritesPaused` already
  // disables the actions that would need the desktop. Those three are
  // the honest, proportionate report, and they are already built. The
  // rule from #602 -- cached data is MARKED, not hidden -- is the same
  // rule one layer up: unreachable must not mean blank.
  //
  // `get_cached` is the one read the companion serves from its stored
  // snapshot, so there is genuinely something to show. Where there is
  // not, `PrList` renders its own empty state, which is honest too.

                `/401|unauthorized|bad credentials/i` over the banner's
                prose, which is the last of the three guesses #1202
                named -- and unlike the other two it had no type to stop
                guessing at: `AuthError` in `auth.rs` covers every way of
                never GETTING a token and has no variant for one that was
                valid and has since been refused. So the variant came
                first, at the point the condition is known.

                It was also wrong, which is the argument for typing it
                rather than tidying it. `ClientError::Api` renders
                octocrab's `Error::GitHub` as the bare word "GitHub", so
                a real HTTP 401 reached this line as "GitHub request
                failed: GitHub" and matched none of the three
                alternatives. The remedy never appeared for the case it
                was written for; it fired only when GitHub happened to
                word a GraphQL body "Bad credentials".
                `github::client` now decides on `status_code` and both
                shapes arrive as one kind. */}
