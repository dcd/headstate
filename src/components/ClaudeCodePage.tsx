/// The sessions list is virtualized, and this is the note that used to
/// be `RENDER_CAP = 200` (#1200).
///
/// # What the cap was, and why it is gone
///
/// The list drew 200 rows, stated the real total, and offered "Show
/// all". That was honest -- it never lied about how much there was --
/// but the remedy it offered was expensive. Measured on this machine's
/// 2,561 transcripts:
///
/// | rows painted | expand | DOM nodes |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | 200 (the cap) | 53 ms | 3,418 |
/// | 600 | 125 ms | 10,215 |
/// | 1,200 | 303 ms | 20,415 |
/// | 2,561 (Show all) | 627 ms | 43,552 |
///
/// So "Show all" was a button whose documented cost was a visibly frozen
/// window, and the cap existed because that cost was real.
///
/// Virtualizing pays it down: the window now paints a screenful plus
/// overscan wherever the reader has scrolled to, so every row is
/// reachable and the DOM stays the size of one screen. `virtualWindow.ts`
/// carries the arithmetic and the measurement table.
///
/// # Why the "showing N of M" notice went with it
///
/// Because it would no longer be true. That notice exists under this
/// project's rule that a partial render must say it is partial -- and
/// the rendering IS still partial, in the sense that most rows are not
/// in the DOM at any moment. What changed is that partial-ness is no
/// longer something the reader has to act on: scrolling reaches every
/// row, with no control to find and no second render cost to pay. A
/// notice saying "showing 30 of 2,561" beside a list that scrolls
/// through all 2,561 would be describing the implementation, not the
/// user's situation, and telling someone their list is short when it is
/// not is its own kind of wrong.
///
/// The counts above the list are unchanged and still carry the totals --
/// "1,438 of 2,561 match", "2,561 sessions" -- so the corpus size is
/// still stated on screen. What is gone is only the claim that some of
/// it is being withheld, which is no longer the case.
///
/// # What virtualization costs, stated plainly
///
/// A row that is not painted is not in the accessibility tree. Native
/// `Cmd-F` cannot reach it, and neither can a screen reader's element
/// list, until it scrolls in. That is a real regression against a fully
/// painted list and it is the tradeoff #1200 was opened to decide.
///
/// It is acceptable here for one reason, which is the sequencing #1233
/// established: find-over-data already covers every row rather than
/// every painted row. The search box filters the whole array and the
/// count is complete, so the question "is the session I want in here"
/// is answered without painting anything. `findOverData.ts` states that
/// contract. Native find-in-page could not answer it even under the old
/// cap -- it only saw 200 rows -- so what is lost is find-in-page over a
/// "Show all" list that cost 627 ms to produce.

/// Claude Code sessions on this machine, and how to get one back.
///
/// # What this component holds, after #939
///
/// The selected session's DETAIL, and the banners saying what could not
/// be read. Not the list: the search box and the session rows moved into
/// `ClaudeCodeSidebar` as `ClaudeSessionColumn`, because a `w-96` column of
/// searchable rows inside the main panel was a second sidebar standing
/// beside the real one. This file still states the rules the list obeys --
/// ordering, the four search fields, the cap -- because they are rules
/// about the same data this page is about, and `useMatchedSessions` below
/// is the one place they are implemented.
///
/// The phone is the exception, and it is why the list is a component
/// rather than a block of JSX in the sidebar: below `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT`
/// the sidebar is a `Sheet` that closes on navigation, so this page mounts
/// `ClaudeSessionColumn` in the main panel instead and keeps the
/// list-then-detail pair of screens it always had. The sidebar's doc
/// comment carries the table of both mount points.
///
/// # What the list is ordered by, and why it is not grouped
///
/// **Most recent activity first, with running sessions pinned above
/// everything.** Not start time: a session touched ten minutes ago
/// matters more than one started earlier and abandoned. Running sessions
/// leave the ordering entirely because there are never more than a
/// handful (three on the development machine at its busiest) and they are
/// the reason the view is open -- a live session at position 900 because
/// its last write was slow is the failure to avoid.
///
/// It is a FLAT list, and that is a decision against the obvious one.
/// Grouping by directory was measured first and does not work here:
///
/// ```text
/// distinct cwds                       662  (over 1,438 sessions)
/// distinct repo roots (worktrees folded) 346
///   of those, holding 1 session        217   <- 63% singletons
///   of those, holding >100 sessions      2   <- 55% of ALL sessions
/// ```
///
/// So a collapsed tree would be 217 one-row groups plus one group
/// holding 662 rows. That is a flat list with extra clicks in front of
/// it, and the big group still needs search to be usable. Search is
/// therefore the primary navigation and grouping is not offered.
///
/// # Why search covers five fields
///
/// `aiTitle` names 1,436 of 1,438 sessions, so title-first search is
/// what makes the list usable -- "the one about notarization" is how
/// people remember sessions. But titles are NOT unique: 286 sessions
/// (19.9%) share a title with another, and inside the largest group 147
/// do, mostly repeated `/security-review` runs ("scan.rs security
/// review" appears ten times). So the row shows a date and a path
/// alongside the title, and search also covers the directory, the branch
/// and the id -- the id for pasting one in from somewhere else.
///
/// # No `Date.now()` anywhere
///
/// `now` arrives from `useClaudeSessions` as the poll's
/// `dataUpdatedAt`. Reading the clock during render would make this
/// impure, which `yarn lint` rejects and which `Sparkline` and
/// `HealthConditions` both carry comments about: a repaint triggered by
/// anything at all would otherwise slide every relative time under
/// unchanged data.
///
/// # A sixth axis: the pull request the query names (#1280)
///
/// The five fields answer "which session was about X". They cannot
/// answer "which session produced this pull request", which is the
/// question asked when a PR breaks -- and it is the more useful
/// direction, because that session holds the context to fix it.
///
/// `useClaudeSessionsForPrQuery` resolves a query shaped like `#1234`,
/// `owner/repo#1234` or a pasted GitHub URL through the link table
/// `claude_sessions_for_pr` reads, and its answer is UNIONED with the
/// text hits rather than replacing them: a query of `1234` still matches
/// every title and prompt containing those digits. `parsePrQuery`
/// carries the full argument for which shapes trigger it.
///
/// # Absent is not zero: nine conditions, nine renderings
///
/// Ten until #1545, which removed "a bare `#1234` whose repository we
/// cannot name": the lookup is by number alone now, so it is always made.
///
/// | condition | rendering |
/// |---|---|
/// | the session list could not be read | `QueryError` with the reason. NOT "no sessions". |
/// | the live registry could not be read | a banner; every row's liveness becomes "could not tell" |
/// | the transcript rescan partly failed | a line saying how many could not be read, above a list that still shows |
/// | `~/.claude/projects` does not exist | `NoSessions` names the path and what creates it. NOT a partial read (#970). |
/// | the SEARCH matched nothing | "No session matches that search" -- about the query, not the machine |
/// | the CHIP matched nothing | "No session is in this filter" (#949) -- about the control, not the machine |
/// | genuinely nothing | `NoSessions` -- only when the read SUCCEEDED and nothing was narrowed |
/// | the PR lookup ran and found nothing | "No session recorded for `owner/repo#1234`" (#1280) -- a finding about the link table |
/// | the PR lookup FAILED | "Could not look up ..." -- not a finding at all, and never worded as the row above |
///
/// The last two are `PrQueryNote`'s, which argues each wording where
/// it is rendered. They are stated beside the COUNTS rather than in the
/// empty list, because they are true whether or not the text filter also
/// matched something -- a pull request with no recorded session and a
/// search that matched forty rows is an ordinary combination.
///
/// The count was "four" until #970 and stayed there through the fifth row
/// it added; it is corrected here rather than left, since a heading that
/// undercounts its own table is the reader's first reason to stop trusting
/// it.
///
/// The `~/.claude/projects` row is #970's correction, and it was a failure
/// hiding inside the partial-read one: the absent root travelled in
/// `unreadable_dirs`, so a machine that had never run Claude Code was told
/// "0 sessions read, but 1 could not be -- this list is incomplete by an
/// unknown amount". It now arrives in `absent_root`, which `is_partial()`
/// does not consult, and `NoSessions` renders it as the explanation it
/// always was.
///
/// The last three rows all render an EMPTY list and must not be confused,
/// which is why `ClaudeSessionColumn` tests them in that order: `NoSessions`
/// is a claim about the machine -- it names the path and offers a rescan --
/// so it may only be reached when nothing was narrowed. Under an active chip
/// it would tell a user with 1,474 sessions that they have none.
///
/// The precedent is `ClaudeMdPage` (#846), one view over, where a `= []`
/// default made a rejected scan read as "No CLAUDE.md files in this
/// repository" -- a confident wrong answer to a question the app could
/// not answer. The error arm is ordered BEFORE the empty arm here for
/// that exact reason: with a `[]` default the empty branch is reached
/// first and an error arm after it is unreachable in the case it exists
/// for.

/// |---|---|
/// | the lookup ran and returned nothing | "No session recorded for `owner/repo#1234`." |
/// | the lookup rejected | "Could not look up `owner/repo#1234` (reason)." |
/// | the text filter matched nothing | "No session matches that search." -- rendered by the list below, not here |
///
/// The first two are about the PULL REQUEST and are stated here, beside
/// the counts, because they are true whether or not the text filter also
/// matched something. The third is about the QUERY and belongs with the
/// empty list, which is where it has always been.
///
/// Collapsing any two of these is the defect #846 and #1044 are both
/// about. "No session recorded for #1234" is a finding: we asked the
/// link table and it holds nothing, which is the ordinary answer for a
/// pull request opened by hand, by CI, or since the transcripts were
/// last read -- the link table is written by the import (#1545), and
/// topped up about once a minute by the live pass since #1557, so a
/// just-opened PR can be a minute behind. "Could not look up #1234" is not a finding at all --
/// the database did not answer, and the pull request may well have a
/// session we simply could not see. Rendering the second as the first
/// would tell a user their session is gone on the strength of a failed
/// read.
///
/// A bare `#1234` used to have a fourth wording, "Could not tell which
/// repository", for a number the tracked open pull requests could not
/// place -- which was every merged one. #1545 looks the number up in
/// the link table directly, so it is always asked and that state is gone.
///
/// # "shown below" is counted, not assumed (#1545)
///
/// The list is also narrowed by the chip and the subagent toggle, and a
/// session the lookup found can be outside both. The note says how many
/// of them the list actually shows, rather than promising rows the
/// reader then cannot find.
///
/// # A qualified miss says where the number WAS found
///
/// A link keeps the repository's name from when the PR was opened, so a
/// transferred repository's older links carry the old owner. When

                point. #914's correction records that the naive glob
                "would list ~2x the real sessions, and every phantom row
                would offer a `--resume` handle for something that was
                never a session" -- so this must not read as "sessions
                Headstate declined to show".

                Suppressed at zero, not qualified: zero subagent files is
                the common case on a new machine and a clause reading "0
                skipped" is noise about an exclusion that did not happen.
                That is the same call the `sessions > 0` gate above makes,
                and #976's rule -- qualify when a short read makes a figure
                only LOW, suppress when it makes it misleading. */}

///
/// "What was this session doing" is usually answered by the worktree's
/// own state -- whether the branch merged, whether there is uncommitted
/// work, whether it is safe to remove -- and that state already has a
/// view. So the session detail states the verdict and offers the jump,
/// rather than reproducing the Worktrees page inside itself.
///
/// # No jump is offered unless one actually matches
///
/// A minority of sessions match a registered worktree, and the ones that
/// do are overwhelmingly the ones whose directory still exists. The rest
/// are agent worktrees deleted when their work landed, and for those there
/// is genuinely nothing to jump to. A button that navigated to a list where
/// the row is absent would be worse than no button, so the section renders
/// the reason instead.
///
/// The exact rates are deliberately NOT stated here. They were ("206 of
/// 1,461 -- 14.1% of all sessions, 83.1% of the 248 whose directory still
/// exists"), and they drifted: a figure measured once is correct on the day
/// it is written and decays from then on (#969). The share is also
/// per-machine -- a property of how the reader works, not of this code --
/// so a number here describes the author's laptop rather than the reader's.
///
/// What the design rests on is the RULE, not the rate: a match requires the
/// directory to still exist, so a session whose cwd is gone can never have
/// one. That is a property of `sessionWorktree`, and `worktrees.test.ts`
/// asserts it by measuring a corpus rather than by remembering a number.
///

///
/// | condition | rendering |
/// |---|---|
/// | the worktree listing could not be read | says so. NOT "no worktree". |

/// | a worktree matched | the verdict, the branch caveat, and the jump |

/// misfired.

///   "gone" would send the user looking for work that was never lost.
/// - `not-recorded` -- we never knew the path. Distinct again: there is
