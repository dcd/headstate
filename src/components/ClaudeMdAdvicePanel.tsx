/// cached answer says `stale: true`, and `adviceState` composes the two
/// into the "from cache, refreshing" state the backend deliberately
/// cannot claim for itself (see `ClaudeMdAdviceFreshness`).

  //
  //  - the cached answer says a tracked input has changed (`stale`), so

  //  - the user pressed Refresh for THIS repository.
  //
  // `needsRefresh` is deliberately false for `"unverified"`: an input
  // that could not be READ will not read on a second run either, so
  // auto-firing there would spend the whole-body session read on every
  // visit to a repository with one unreadable file and learn nothing.
  // Refresh still works; what is refused is doing it unprompted.
  //
  // # Rapid repository switching
  //
  // This is why the trigger is derived from `cached.data` rather than
  // held in state. `cached.data` is the CURRENT repository's cached
  // result -- the query key carries the path, so switching repositories
  // makes it `undefined` until that repository's own cached call lands.
  // A fresh call can therefore only be enabled for a repository whose
  // cached report is already in hand and already says `stale`, which a
  // user clicking down a sidebar never reaches: each click invalidates
  // the previous repository's `cached.data` before any fresh call for it
  // is enabled. Clicking through ten repositories fires ten cached reads
  // and no producer runs.
  //
  // And a fresh call that DID start keeps its own query key, so it can
  // neither be mistaken for the new repository's answer nor race another
  // run of itself: TanStack dedupes by key, so one repository has at
  // most one fresh call in flight however many times the trigger
