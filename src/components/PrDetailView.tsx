          above the viewport and "View on GitHub" far below it, so
          approving meant scrolling to the top and opening it on GitHub
          meant scrolling to the bottom.

          The scroll container is `<main>` in App, which is this
          element's scrolling ancestor -- that is what makes `sticky`
          work here at all.

          `top-0` was correct once and is NOT any more (#1278). This
          comment used to read "the app header above scrolls away with
          the content rather than being sticky itself, so nothing
          overlaps"; #623 made that app header `sticky top-0 z-20` for
          the phone layout, in this same scroll container. At `top-0`
          this bar still pinned -- it just pinned to the exact band the
          app header occupies, one z-layer down and behind its opaque
          background. Sticky was never broken here; the bar was pinned
          and invisible, which looks identical to not sticking at all.

          `--app-header-h` is the app header's measured height, written
          onto `<main>` by `useStickyHeaderOffset`. Measured rather than
          hardcoded because the phone's header is taller than the
          desktop's (a 44px `.tap-target` hamburger), so one number
          would be wrong on one of the two layouts this component
          serves. The fallback keeps the bar pinned somewhere sane if
          the variable is ever missing -- in jsdom, for instance, where
          nothing publishes it.

          On the phone every control in the bar gets the 44px floor
          (`.tap-target`'s numbers, #1580), set once here rather than on
          each button: the Merge and Approve buttons come from
          `PrActions` and the row above, and one missed button is one
          control too small for a finger. */}
