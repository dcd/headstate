/// Stats, charts and actions for managing Claude Code sessions (#921).
///
/// # What is on this page, and what was cut
///
/// #921 lists five candidates -- sessions over time, sessions that ended
/// without a `SessionEnd`, longest-running, busiest directories, version
/// spread -- and asks for a cut rather than all five, on one test: *does
/// this help me see what is going on, or resurrect something?* Four
/// panels ship. Each rejection below is a decision with a measurement
/// behind it, taken on the real 1,461-session corpus on this machine.
///
/// ## Shipped
///
/// **1. Three tiles: running, resumable, archived.** The page's reason to
/// exist. `resumable` is the headline -- see the correction below.
///
/// **2. The resumable list.** The actionable surface, and the centrepiece:
/// the newest of the sessions that can be resumed back into the tree they
/// came from, each with its command on one click.
///
/// **3. Sessions started per day.** The one chart. It earns its place on
/// the second-order reading: the shape is how you notice that you started
/// 34 sessions yesterday and can resume 248 of 1,461 ever, which is the
/// fact behind the 83% whose directory is gone.
///
/// **4. A scan-health line.** Absent-is-not-zero applied to the statistics
/// themselves: when the live registry could not be read, or records in it
/// could not be used, every figure above is wrong by an unknown amount and
/// the page has to say so.
///
/// ## Cut, and why
///
/// **Longest-running session.** Cut as a number that would be a lie with
/// a plausible shape. The only duration available is last activity minus
/// first activity, and a session that ran for four minutes and then sat
/// open in a terminal for eight hours measures as eight hours. Nothing in
/// the data distinguishes working from idling -- the transcript records
/// turns, not attention -- so the figure would rank abandoned sessions
/// above intense ones while looking like a measure of effort. A wrong
/// number with a credible shape is worse than no number.
///
/// **Version spread.** Cut as a fact about upgrades, not about sessions.
/// Measured here: 37 distinct `claude` versions across the corpus, the
/// top one holding 95 sessions. It answers "how often do I update Claude
/// Code", which is a real question and not one this page is for -- and
/// neither seeing what is going on nor resurrecting anything turns on it.
///
/// **Busiest directories.** The closest call, and cut on measurement. 665
/// distinct working directories over 1,461 sessions, and the top entries
/// are `.claude/worktrees/agent-*` and `.worktrees/*` -- agent worktrees,
/// since deleted. So a leaderboard of them is a ranking of directories
/// that mostly do not exist, and its rows lead nowhere: you cannot resume
/// into a tree that is gone. The 17% that DO exist are already the
/// resumable list, which is the same information ordered by what you can
/// act on rather than by count. A `RepoTable`-shaped panel here would be
/// the page's most visually assertive element sitting on its weakest
/// footing, which is the caveat `RepoTable`'s own comment exists for.
///
/// **Total sessions as a hero number.** Cut as vanity. "1,461 sessions
/// ever" answers nothing; it appears only as the denominator under the
/// tiles, which is the one job it does.
///
/// # The correction to #921's headline figure
///
/// #921 proposes that the most valuable number is "how many sessions are
/// resurrection candidates -- dead pid, no clean end", and calls it the
/// feature's whole reason to exist. The premise is right and the predicate
/// is wrong, measurably: **it matches zero sessions.**
///
/// A pid reaches `claude_run` only from the `SessionStart` hook (#912,
/// #913). All 1,461 sessions here were imported from transcripts, and a
/// transcript import is forbidden from writing a run at all -- migration
/// 11 declares `claude_run.pid NOT NULL` precisely so an unobserved
/// process cannot be recorded as an observed one. Nor is that transient:
/// sessions that ran before the hook was installed can never acquire a pid
/// retroactively, which is the entire history on any machine that adopts
/// Headstate after using Claude Code.
///
/// The predicate that selects the actionable set is **not running, and its
/// directory still exists**: 248 of 1,461. That is `resumable`, it is the
/// page's headline, and #921's predicate ships beside it as
/// `orphaned_runs` -- honest at 0 today, and the sharper signal once the
/// hook is observing, since `SessionEnd` does not fire on SIGKILL.
/// `never_observed` is what lets a reader tell "nothing crashed" from
/// "nothing was watched".
///
/// # This page and the session list now answer the same question (#984)
///
/// They did not. `resumable` counts a session as not-running the moment it
/// is absent from the running set -- 183 of 1,491 measured -- while
/// `liveness::derive` returned `Unknown` for every session the hook had
/// never observed, which was 1,490 of the same 1,491 rows. So this page
/// said "183 of these are ready to resume" and the list beside it said it
/// could not tell whether any of them was running, off one registry read.
///
/// `claude/mod.rs` states the rule that was being broken: this page
/// "derives no liveness of its own -- #917's `liveness` module owns that,
/// and two answers to one question disagree the first time either
/// changes." The fix was in `liveness::derive` rather than here, because
/// this page's reading was the consistent one: a registry listing we read
/// WHOLE that does not name a session is positive evidence. Nothing on
/// this page changed; the list stopped hedging. Measured after:
/// `running 1  dead 1490  unknown 0`, and 183 of the 1,490 have a live
/// directory -- which is `resumable` exactly.
///
/// #1534 was the same disagreement the other way round: the list rightly
/// said "could not tell" for rows a terminal-launched session might be,
/// and this page, counting from a separate running-ids set, still offered
/// them for resumption. Since then every row's verdict comes off the
/// session list itself (`overview.rs`'s `report`), so the two cannot
/// disagree, and a row the list cannot decide is counted in
/// `liveness_unknown` and offered nowhere.
///
/// # Absent is not zero, and a chart is the worst place to break it
///
/// Four distinct failures, four renderings, none of them a zero:
///
/// | condition | rendering |
/// |---|---|
/// | the aggregate query failed | `QueryError` with the reason. **Not** a page of zeros. |
/// | the live registry could not be read | the page, with a banner; `running` and `resumable` render "could not tell" |
/// | registry records could not be used, or a session runs with none | the page, with a banner saying `running` is a floor |
/// | the cache is genuinely empty | "no sessions", and an offer to rescan -- only when the read SUCCEEDED |
///
/// The error arm is ordered FIRST, before the empty one. That ordering is
/// the half of #846's fix its own guard cannot check, and it matters more
/// here than on a list: a zeroed struct would draw 30 chart columns and a
/// "0 resumable" tile that look exactly like a measured quiet month,
/// because **a flat line does not look absent**. On this machine that
/// would be a confident "nothing to resume" over 248 resumable sessions.
///
/// # No `Date.now()` in render
///
/// `now` comes from the poll's `dataUpdatedAt` via `useClaudeOverview`,
/// the way `Sparkline` and `HealthConditions` take it. `yarn lint` forbids
/// the clock read, and the rule is right for its own reason as well: a
/// re-render would otherwise shift every "2 days ago" under unchanged
/// data.
///
/// # Why this route is lazy, and the trap in proving it
///
/// This page reaches `recharts` through `stats/SessionsChart` ->
/// `ui/chart`, and #838's boundary is the ROUTE in `App.tsx`, not the
/// chart: `recharts` is 9.3 MB on disk, the launch chunk is 31% smaller
/// for keeping it off, and the measured cost of getting this wrong is the
/// launch chunk back from 945,919 to 1,378,820 bytes and ~8ms on the
/// median time to React's first commit.
///
/// So this component must be reached ONLY through `lazy(() => import(...))`
/// with no static import of it anywhere in `App.tsx`, and it must be added
/// to the `it.each` table in `App.lazy.test.tsx` in the same change --
/// that guard reads `App.tsx?raw` and is SOURCE-SHAPE ONLY, so a new
/// charting route nobody added to the table sails through CI while
/// silently regressing the bundle. There is no bundle-size gate to catch
/// it (`vite.config.ts` has no `manualChunks`, by documented choice).
///
/// Verified on the build rather than inferred -- `VITE_TARGET=mobile yarn
/// build` then `grep -c recharts` over each chunk, with the counts recorded
/// in the pull request.
///
/// The SESSIONS page (#917) is deliberately NOT lazy, and the split is the
/// point: the page you open to get work back after a crash must not wait
/// on a chunk fetch, and the page you open to look at charts can.
