///
/// - **not measured** -- we have no reading. Rendered in words, never a

/// - **measured zero** -- the scan read every transcript and this plugin
///   was in none of them. A real fact, and the page's most common one:
///   7 of 22 installed plugins show any usage at all.
/// - **not countable** -- the plugin ships nothing that can produce a
///   tool call. `clangd-lsp`'s install path holds a LICENSE and a
///   README; it contributes background behaviour and always will. Its
///   zero measures nothing about the user's habits, so the page declines
