/// | 10 | **1** | 1.26-1.50s |
/// | 36 | **1** | 3.62-4.15s |
///
/// So alias count is free on rate limit and linear in latency, exactly as
/// #823 measured for the history document -- and this is the CHEAP document

/// where 10 node-bearing aliases at a 50-node page failed outright at the
/// ~11s deadline (`board.rs`'s table). That is also why the page size is
/// never raised: `fetch::SLICE_PAGE_FULL` is 50 and `degrade` sheds pages
/// before aliases because NODES drive the deadline, and this document
/// materialises none.
///
/// `totalCount` is read UNPAGED and must stay that way. #826's measurement
/// is that the `first:` ARGUMENT is what GitHub prices, not the connection
/// -- so adding `first:` to a connection read only for a count would buy
