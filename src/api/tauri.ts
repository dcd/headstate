/// The COMMAND STRING could not follow. It is matched as a literal in

/// figures come from `sizeWorktrees`, `sizeArtifacts`, `sizeVenvs` and

/// Worktrees, Artifacts and Docker views show. They take seconds to tens
/// of seconds (`size_worktrees` was the #661 timeout at ~13s for 147
/// worktrees) and must never share a call site with something this
