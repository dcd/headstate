/// # What is being defended
///
/// `claude_sessions` returned every row with every field on every
/// ten-second poll: 1,474 rows, 990 bytes each, 1.35 MB, and the phone
/// paid it over the pairing transport. The fix splits the row by FIELD --
/// the list keeps what it searches, filters, counts and draws; the rest
/// is fetched for the one selected session -- and interns the one field
/// the list does render that was almost entirely repetition, the liveness
/// reason, which was the same 150-character sentence on 1,474 of 1,474
/// real rows.
///
/// These tests are about the interning half, because that is the half
/// that could silently lose something. A dropped `why` would leave "Not
/// running" with no grounds; a mis-resolved one would put a different
/// session's grounds under it, which is worse. So the assertions are that
/// the sentence survives byte-for-byte, that distinct reasons stay
/// distinct, and that a table which cannot answer produces `unknown`
/// rather than a fabricated or empty verdict.
