# ---- Mobile companion (src-mobile) ---------------------------------------
#
# A separate crate with its own lockfile; see src-mobile/Cargo.toml for
# why. None of these targets is part of `lint` or `test` above: the
# desktop gates stay exactly what CI runs, and the mobile ones need the
# iOS or Android toolchain (#518 gives them their own CI job).
#
# `TAURI_APP_PATH` is load-bearing on every `yarn tauri` call. Yarn runs
# package scripts from the workspace root, and from there the Tauri CLI
# finds `src-tauri` first -- so without it `yarn tauri ios init` sets up
# the DESKTOP crate for iOS. This was observed, not inferred.
#
# The shared frontend, built for the phone. `tauri ios build` runs this
# itself through `beforeBuildCommand`; it is here for anyone driving
# xcodebuild directly. `cargo check` and `cargo test` do NOT need it:
# the crate was verified to compile with `dist/` absent.

# Install and run on a REAL device, for the pairing walkthrough
# (docs/mobile-pairing-walkthrough.md). The walkthrough refuses
# simulators and emulators, correctly: they have no Secure Enclave, no
# Keystore-backed biometric gate, and iOS does not show the
# local-network prompt in the simulator -- so three of the things the
# run exists to check cannot be checked there.
#
# `--open` hands off to Xcode rather than building headless. Signing a
# development build needs a team, and the committed project carries none
# (`DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` is absent by design -- it is personal to whoever
# builds, and the release workflow injects its own). Xcode's Signing &
# Capabilities tab is where a person selects theirs, once, and the
# setting stays in their local checkout.
#
# `--host` goes with `--open`, per Tauri's own help: a device cannot
# reach `localhost`, so the dev server has to be served on the public
# network address. Vite already listens on 0.0.0.0 for this to work.
#

# ---- Parity with CI (#853) -----------------------------------------------
#
# Three things CI ran that no `make` target could, so a developer could
# not reproduce a CI failure locally even knowing which check had failed.
# Deliberately NOT added to `lint` or `test`: each is slow or installs a
# toolchain, and the cheap-guards rule the `lint-deps` comment states
# ("answer a question in a second") is what keeps those targets worth
# running. These are the ones you run when CI is red, or before a release.
#
# `deny-mobile` already existed for the phone crate; the desktop's
# `src-tauri/deny.toml` had no target at all, which is why a supply-chain
# failure was only ever reachable by pushing.
deny:
	cd src-tauri && cargo deny check

# The race check, matching CI's `Race check` step exactly (ci.yml):
# three runs of the library tests at eight threads.
#
# THE COSTLY OMISSION of the three. CI repeats the suite three times
# precisely because one green run does not prove a race is absent, and
# before this there was no local way to ask -- so a state-touching change
# looked fine locally and failed from a job that had run the same tests
# twice more. #834's flake was found exactly this way.
#
# `--lib` and the iteration count are CI's, not a guess: matching them is
# the point, since a local run that differed would not reproduce what CI
# saw.

		cargo test --lib -- --test-threads=8 || { echo "FAILED ON ITERATION $$i"; exit 1; }; \
	done

# Mutation testing, ONE MODULE AT A TIME and never in CI (#893).
#
# `--in-place` is load-bearing, not a preference. cargo-mutants normally
# copies the crate directory to a temp dir, and two tests read files
# OUTSIDE it -- `github/model.rs:553` pulls in `src/lib/derive.ts` and
# `github/query.rs:739` pulls in `README.md`, both via `include_str!` with
# `../../../`. In a copied tree those reads fail and the baseline never
# builds:
#
#   error: couldn't read `src/github/../../../src/lib/derive.ts`
#   FAILED   Unmutated baseline
#
# Which is worth pausing on: the cross-language mirror tests that FIXED
# #850 are what broke the tool best suited to finding more #850s. There is
# no config option to copy extra paths, so `--in-place` -- testing in the
# source tree -- is the fix. It restores the tree afterwards; only
# `mutants.out/` is left behind, and that is gitignored.
#
# NOT IN CI, deliberately. 3272 mutants crate-wide, each run rebuilding
# the dependency tree; a single file's shard did not finish in 3 minutes.
# Against a CI budget whose critical path is ~9 minutes this is not a
# gate, it is an audit you run on purpose.
#
# A MISSED mutant is a test that cannot fail -- which is exactly what this
# repo shipped in #850 (constants asserted against one side) and #868 (six
# tests skipping a documented lock). Measured on the first real run:
# `src/tray.rs` alone has three.

# The release ships a UNIVERSAL binary while every test job builds native

# octocrab's crypto backends) would first appear at TAG time, after
# version stamping, mid-release. `cargo check` rather than a second build,
# for the reason ci.yml gives: it catches the compile and
# link-configuration failures that differ by target without doubling the
# time.

# What a fresh checkout needs before `lint` can evaluate any code.
#
# Deliberately NOT a dependency of `lint` (#1155). That target's contract
# is answers in a second and this one shells out to five toolchains; it
# is the step BEFORE the gate, run once in a new worktree rather than on
# every cycle.
#
# It also does not fail on an absent OPTIONAL tool -- no Android NDK is
# correct on a machine that never builds for Android. It exits non-zero
# only for the two conditions that actually stop `lint` before it reads
# any code, which is what makes a non-zero exit here worth reading.
#
# The cost it removes: `lint` in a fresh worktree dies with "Couldn't
# find the node_modules state file", which names none of its causes. The
# `verify` skill records hitting that twice in one cycle, and with ~100
# sibling worktrees here a fresh one is the normal case.

# fixtures spell the bad import on purpose, and rewriting them would

# `yarn tauri icon` also emits Windows/iOS/Android icon variants this
# macOS-only app never uses, and its ICNS encoder is non-deterministic --
# re-running against unchanged source art re-packs icon.icns with different
# compressed-stream bytes even though every image inside is pixel-identical.
# Restore the 1024 master over icon.png (as before), prune the unused
# variants, and restore the committed icon.icns bytes when its *content*
# (not raw bytes) matches what's already committed -- so a second run of
# this target leaves `git status` clean.
